### india's market rally, dollar weakness, gold surge & trump's tariff drama

## Market Overview

The market experienced dramatic swings this week as global trade tensions dominated investor sentiment. Indian equities showed exceptional resilience amid the turmoil, with the **Sensex** surging **1,400 points** (1.90%) to close at **75,247** and the **Nifty50** rising **441 points** (1.97%) to reach **22,840**. This performance was largely driven by the US announcing a **90-day suspension** of additional tariffs on India, providing temporary relief to exporters.

Meanwhile, the **US dollar** weakened significantly against safe-haven currencies, falling to a **decade-low** against the **Swiss franc** as confidence in US assets deteriorated. **Gold prices** hit record highs above **$3,200 per ounce** as recession fears intensified amid the trade war. In corporate news, **TCS** reported disappointing Q4 results with net profit falling **1.7%** year-on-year to **₹12,224 crore**, missing analyst expectations.

<u>**Trump tariff chaos grips global markets**</u>

Global markets experienced a week of extraordinary volatility after President **Trump** announced steep tariffs on global imports, only to reverse course days later with a **90-day pause** on additional duties for most countries (excluding China). This whiplash-inducing policy shift triggered one of the most turbulent weeks in recent market history.

The initial tariff announcement sent global markets into a tailspin, with the **S&P 500** falling sharply before staging its largest single-day rally since 2008 (surging **9.5%**) following the partial rollback. The euphoria proved short-lived, however, as reality set in that a **10% blanket tariff** remained in effect alongside escalated duties of **145%** on Chinese imports.

By Thursday, US stocks had surrendered most gains, with the **S&P 500** dropping **3.5%**, the **Nasdaq** falling **4.3%**, and the **Dow** shedding **2.5%** as investors recognized the continuing trade tensions. Asian markets mirrored this instability, with **Japan's Nikkei** plunging **5.6%** on Friday.

The erratic policy shifts have severely undermined market confidence, with several analysts suggesting this volatility signals deeper concerns about US economic governance. Even with the temporary reprieve, **Goldman Sachs** still places recession probability at **45%** (down from 65%), reflecting persistent anxiety about the broader economic impacts of trade disruption.

<u>**Dollar slides to decade-low as investors flee to safe havens**</u>

The US dollar experienced a dramatic depreciation this week, hitting its lowest level against the **Swiss franc** in a decade as investors lost confidence in US assets amid escalating trade tensions. This decline marks a significant shift in global currency dynamics, with potential far-reaching implications for international trade and investment.

The dollar fell **1.2%** against the Swiss franc to **0.81405**, while also dropping **0.9%** against the **Japanese yen** and **1.7%** against the **euro**, reaching its highest level since February 2022 at **$1.13855**. This flight from the dollar reflects growing concerns about US policy unpredictability and its impact on the global economy.

Market strategist **Chris Weston** pointed to a pronounced "sell US" sentiment, with significant reallocations away from US assets. The weakening dollar coincided with a sharp rise in Treasury yields, with 10-year yields poised for their largest weekly increase since 2001, suggesting a broader re-evaluation of US financial assets.

This currency movement has created attractive opportunities for gold investors, pushing the precious metal to an all-time high of **$3,219.23 per ounce**. Central banks worldwide have been substantial buyers of gold, further supporting prices as they seek to diversify reserves away from dollar-denominated assets.

The Chinese yuan, after initially hitting its weakest level since 2007 at **7.3518** per dollar, recovered slightly as Beijing appeared to allow a controlled depreciation to partially offset the impact of US tariffs on Chinese exports.

<u>**India's surprising resilience: Sensex surges 1,400 points despite global turmoil**</u>

Indian equity markets demonstrated remarkable resilience this week, with the **Sensex** surging **1,400 points** (1.90%) and the **Nifty50** rising **441 points** (1.97%) despite the global market tumult. This strength was primarily fueled by the US announcement of a **90-day suspension** of the additional **26% tariff** on India, offering a significant reprieve for Indian exporters.

The market rally was broad-based, with particularly strong performances in the **Nifty Pharma** and **Metal** indices, which rose over **3%**, while **Nifty Auto** and **Healthcare** gained over **2%**. Individual stocks making notable moves included **Tata Steel** (up **6%** following job cut announcements in the Netherlands), **Sun Pharma** (up **5%** after a favorable US court ruling on its autoimmune drug), and **Biocon** (up nearly **6%** following US FDA approval for its cancer drug).

Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) had been net sellers for eight consecutive sessions, offloading approximately **₹4,358 crore**. However, this outflow was partially offset by Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchasing **₹2,976 crore** worth of equities.

Market experts maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook, suggesting that while the 90-day tariff pause offers temporary relief, broader trade uncertainties persist. **Dr. V.K. Vijayakumar** of Geojit Financial Services emphasized the need for vigilance despite India's macroeconomic strengths, and **Hardik Matalia** from Choice Broking identified immediate support levels for the Nifty at **22,300** with resistance at **22,550**.

<u>**Gold hits record high as recession fears drive safe-haven demand**</u>

Gold prices surged to unprecedented heights this week, reaching a record **$3,219.43 per ounce** as investors sought safe-haven assets amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The precious metal has gained over **5%** this week alone, driven by mounting fears of a global recession and the resultant flight to safety.

The sharp rise follows President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to **145%**, which prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing. This escalation has significantly heightened concerns about global economic stability, with analysts suggesting that continuing trade disputes could push the world economy toward stagflation—a dangerous combination of high inflation and stagnant growth.

Expectations of potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve have further bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation and financial system risk. Meanwhile, strong demand from central banks worldwide continues to provide substantial support for gold prices, with many institutions diversifying their reserves away from traditional currencies.

In India, gold prices reached a record high of **₹92,170 per 10 grams**, with Chennai recording the highest rate at **₹92,270**. Silver prices have also benefited from the risk-off sentiment, climbing to **₹92,030** per kilogram.

As economic uncertainties persist, experts anticipate gold prices may remain elevated, with the market closely monitoring developments in US-China trade relations and central bank policies for signals of further price movement.

<u>**TCS disappoints with Q4 profit drop despite strong deal momentum**</u>

**Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** reported underwhelming fourth-quarter results with a **1.7%** year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to **₹12,224 crore**, falling short of analyst expectations of **₹12,650 crore**. Revenue from operations increased by **5.3%** to **₹64,479 crore**, but also missed projections of **₹64,856 crore**.

The company's operating margin contracted by **27 basis points** to **24.19%**, reflecting challenges in an uncertain global environment. CEO **K Krithivasan** attributed the performance to delays in decision-making and project initiations due to ongoing tariff discussions, though he emphasized that no cancellations had occurred.

Despite these headwinds, TCS reported strong deal momentum with a Total Contract Value (TCV) of **$12.2 billion** for the quarter, improving from **$10.2 billion** in the previous quarter. For the full fiscal year 2025, the company crossed the **$30 billion** revenue milestone, with a net profit increase of **5.76%** to **₹48,553 crore**.

Several brokerages, including **Centrum**, **Nuvama**, and **Motilal Oswal**, maintained their "Buy" ratings on TCS despite revising their target prices downward. They cited the company's robust order book and favorable scaling opportunities as reasons for optimism amid current challenges.

In a significant management change, TCS appointed **Aarthi Subramanian** as President and Chief Operating Officer, effective **May 1, 2025**. The company also announced plans to hire **42,000** freshers in FY26, maintaining its commitment to talent acquisition despite economic uncertainties.

<u>**RBI lowers repo rate to 6% as focus shifts to growth support**</u>

The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has cut the repo rate by **25 basis points** to **6%**, marking the second consecutive reduction as the central bank pivots toward supporting economic growth amid global uncertainties. This shift in monetary policy stance from 'neutral' to 'accommodative' signals a more growth-oriented approach as inflation concerns have moderated.

Economists now project the terminal repo rate could fall to **5.25-5.5%** by the end of 2025, with some even suggesting it could reach **5%** by December. These forecasts are underpinned by expectations of consecutive quarter-point rate cuts in upcoming policy meetings, with **Nomura** and other institutions predicting a total reduction of **100 basis points** by year-end.

The rate cut has prompted immediate responses from lenders, with **Bank of Baroda** reducing its external benchmark-linked lending rates for retail and MSME loans by **25 basis points**, though keeping its Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) unchanged at **9%**.

Market analysts highlight three key factors supporting this easing cycle: lower inflation, the RBI's tax reductions, and the anticipated benefits of a good monsoon season. However, they also caution that bank margins may face pressure as approximately **60%** of loans across commercial banks are pegged to external benchmarks that will reprice quickly, while deposit rates adjust more gradually.

<u>**BlackRock bets big on Adani with $250 million bond investment**</u>

**BlackRock**, the world's largest asset manager, has emerged as the principal investor in **Adani Group's** recent **$750 million** bond issuance, committing approximately **$250 million** to the controversial Indian conglomerate. This marks BlackRock's first private placement in India's infrastructure sector and comes despite ongoing scrutiny of Adani following a US Department of Justice indictment related to bribery allegations.

The bonds, which have a maturity period of **3-5 years**, will finance Adani's acquisition of **ITD Cementation**, a strategic move to enhance the group's engineering capabilities in the infrastructure domain. Five other institutional investors from America and Europe joined BlackRock in supporting the fundraising, indicating broader confidence in Adani's growth trajectory.

This investment aligns with BlackRock Chairman **Larry Fink's** previously expressed optimism about infrastructure as a compelling investment opportunity. The asset manager recently acquired **Global Infrastructure Partners**, underscoring its strategic focus on essential sectors.

The substantial investment represents a significant vote of confidence in Adani, potentially mitigating concerns about the group's fundraising capabilities amid legal challenges. The bond issuance follows a previous successful raise of approximately **$200 million** in February 2025 for Adani's Australian port operations, demonstrating the group's continued access to international capital despite controversy.

<u>**Urban Company secures shareholder approval for ₹528 crore IPO**</u>

**Urban Company**, the Delhi-based home services platform, has received shareholder approval for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) aimed at raising **₹528 crore** through a fresh issue of shares. The company may also include a stake sale by existing investors as part of the offering, though specific details on the use of proceeds will be disclosed in forthcoming offer documents.

The approval comes on the heels of strong financial performance, with Urban Company reporting a **30% increase** in revenue year-on-year to **₹827 crore** for fiscal year 2024. The company has also significantly reduced its loss before tax to **₹93 crore**, compared to **₹312 crore** in the previous fiscal year.

In recent developments, Urban Company launched its **Insta Help** service last month, marking its entry into the quick commerce sector in selected locations across Mumbai. This expansion follows a major liquidity event in July when venture capital firm **Dharana** acquired shares worth **₹400 crore** from Urban Company employees and other shareholders, creating the largest Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) liquidity event in the company's history.

The IPO approval reflects positive investor sentiment and confidence in Urban Company's growth strategy, particularly following its robust financial performance and innovative service introductions. The upcoming market debut will be closely watched as stakeholders assess the deployment of capital and the company's competitive positioning in the evolving home services sector.

<u>**Karnataka leads EV charging infrastructure with 5,880 stations nationwide**</u>

Karnataka has emerged as India's leader in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, boasting **5,880 public charging stations** across the state. This substantial network puts Karnataka ahead of other states like Maharashtra (**2,454 stations**) and Delhi (**1,951 stations**), establishing it as a pioneer in supporting India's electric mobility transition.

The majority of Karnataka's charging infrastructure—**4,626 stations**—is concentrated in Bengaluru, reflecting the city's status as a technology hub. However, the state has also made significant progress in expanding beyond urban centers, with **285 stations** in tier-2 cities and **969 stations** in tier-3 towns, demonstrating a commitment to widespread EV adoption.

This leadership position stems from Karnataka's early policy initiatives—the state introduced India's first EV policy in **2017**, creating a foundation for current achievements. The infrastructure growth has been supported by multiple funding sources, including the Central Government's FAME initiative, investments from **Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom)**, and various public-private partnerships.

Karnataka's government continues to push the EV agenda forward, announcing plans in March 2025 to establish an EV testing track and a dedicated manufacturing cluster, aiming to attract investments of approximately **₹50,000 crore** and create **100,000 jobs**. The state is also electrifying public transportation, with plans to deploy **14,750 electric buses**, including **9,000** for the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation.

<u>**Adani Energy reports tripling of transmission order book to ₹59,936 crore**</u>

**Adani Energy Solutions Ltd.** has announced a significant expansion in its operational capabilities and order book during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The company's under-construction transmission order book has surged to **₹59,936 crore**, tripling from **₹17,000 crore** at the beginning of the fiscal year, reflecting robust bidding activities and successful project acquisitions.

The company's transmission network expanded to **26,696 circuit kilometers (ckm)** with an addition of **140 ckm** during the quarter. Notable project wins include the **Navinal (Mundra) Phase I Part-B 1** and **Mahan Transmission** projects, collectively valued at approximately **₹5,000 crore**.

**Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd.** demonstrated improved operational efficiency, achieving a distribution loss reduction to **4.31%** in the March quarter. The Average System Availability Index remained robust, exceeding **99.9%**. Despite a dip in industrial power demand, the company reported a year-over-year sales increase of **8%**, amounting to **2,413 million units** in the residential and commercial sectors in Mumbai.

The company has also made significant progress in its smart meter initiative, successfully installing around **31 lakh** meters with aspirations to reach a cumulative total of **1 crore meters** by the end of fiscal 2026. The estimated potential market for smart meter installations stands at approximately **97 million units**.

These developments highlight Adani Energy's proactive approach to expanding its infrastructure and efficiency, positioning itself strongly in the energy sector amidst evolving market dynamics.

<u>**Prada acquires Versace for $1.38 billion to form Italy's largest fashion group**</u>

In a landmark deal that reshapes the luxury fashion landscape, **Prada SpA** has acquired **Versace** for approximately **$1.38 billion**, creating Italy's largest fashion conglomerate. The acquisition returns Versace to Italian ownership after its 2018 purchase by **Capri Holdings** for **$2 billion** and positions Prada to more effectively compete with industry giants **LVMH** and **Kering SA**.

This transaction stands as the largest in Prada's 112-year history and has been negotiated over several months. The final price may be adjusted based on Versace's working capital and net debt at closing, which is anticipated in the second half of the current fiscal year.

Prada CEO **Andrea Guerra** emphasized that Versace's integration would introduce diversity and complement the company's established brands. The acquisition aligns with a broader transition within Prada's leadership, as **Lorenzo Bertelli**, son of **Miuccia Prada** and **Patrizio Bertelli**, increasingly influences strategic decisions.

Despite being executed amid global market turbulence and trade tensions, the deal represents a strategic opportunity for both brands. Analysts note that while Versace boasts strong brand recognition, it requires substantial investments for a successful turnaround. However, they see potential for rejuvenation under Prada's stewardship, leveraging the successful track record of Prada and its **Miu Miu** brand, particularly in targeting younger demographics.

<u>**Moody's cuts India's GDP forecast to 6.1% amid US tariff turmoil**</u>

**Moody's Investors Service** has revised India's GDP growth projection downward from **6.4%** to **6.1%** for 2025, citing anticipated impacts from US tariffs affecting key export sectors including gems and jewelry, medical devices, and textiles. Despite the reduction, India's economy is expected to remain relatively insulated due to its lower dependence on external demand compared to other nations.

The forecast reflects growing uncertainty within financial markets, potentially dampening both household and business confidence and hindering the effectiveness of anticipated monetary policy easing. Moody's anticipates that the Reserve Bank of India may respond to declining inflation by cutting interest rates by another **25 basis points**, bringing the policy rate to **5.75%** by year-end.

This adjustment is not unique to India but extends to various Asia-Pacific economies affected by turbulence stemming from US tariff fluctuations. Despite certain tariffs being temporarily reduced to **10% for 90 days**, the potential for a **26% tariff** implementation remains a pivotal concern for India's trade balance.

Market analysts suggest that the combination of monetary easing and planned tax incentives could potentially bolster domestic demand, thus mitigating some negative consequences of the tariffs. Nevertheless, the revised outlook underscores the complexities of global trade dynamics and their direct impact on national economic forecasts.

<u>**Audi India expands EV charging network to over 6,500 points**</u>

**Audi India** has significantly expanded its electric vehicle charging infrastructure, now offering more than **6,500 charging points** nationwide as part of the second phase of its "Charge My Audi" initiative. This expansion adds over **5,500 new charging points** strategically located across highways, urban centers, and commercial destinations.

The company has partnered with **16 new EV infrastructure providers** to enhance the convenience and accessibility of charging for luxury EV owners. Over **75%** of the charging locations feature DC fast-charging technology, aiming to reduce charging times and meet increasing demand for electric mobility.

**Balbir Singh Dhillon**, Head of Audi India, emphasized the importance of a robust charging network in supporting EV adoption, stating, "Establishing a robust charging network is crucial... we are enhancing convenience, reducing charging times, and expanding accessibility for our customers."

This initiative ensures Audi e-tron owners can enjoy seamless long-distance travel and efficient daily commuting options. The expansion aligns with broader trends in increasing electric vehicle adoption in India, where the government and automotive manufacturers are working collaboratively to promote sustainable mobility solutions.

Audi's charging network expansion represents a proactive step toward supporting luxury EV users and addressing infrastructure challenges in the evolving EV landscape, potentially strengthening the company's market position in India's premium electric vehicle segment.
