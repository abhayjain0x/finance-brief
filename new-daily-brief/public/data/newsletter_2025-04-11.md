## Market Overview

Markets whipsawed through an extraordinary 24 hours of volatility as a sudden escalation and partial retreat in the US-China trade war triggered wild swings across global assets. After announcing wide-ranging tariffs against China, Trump unexpectedly paused implementation for 90 days, sending relief through markets that had been in freefall. The **Sensex** surged 1,400 points while **GIFT Nifty** indicated a gap-up open of over 450 points. Meanwhile, global investors continued to seek safety as underlying concerns remain, with **gold hitting record highs** and the **dollar sliding to a decade-low** against the Swiss franc. Asian markets remained under pressure despite the reprieve, with Japan's **Nikkei falling 5.6%** as investors reassess the medium-term implications of renewed trade hostilities.

<u>**Trump's Tariff Zigzag Triggers Market Whiplash**</u>

The markets experienced extraordinary turbulence as **Donald Trump** first announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports before abruptly declaring a 90-day "timeout" on implementation. This sequence of events first sent global markets into a tailspin – with the **S&P 500 plunging nearly 6%** and the **Dow Jones dropping 2,000 points** – before triggering relief rallies across multiple markets.

The policy U-turn didn't come from a position of strength. **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen** acknowledged that the bond market's violent reaction influenced the administration's decision to pause tariffs, as yields spiked dangerously and threatened financial stability. The episode exposed the vulnerability of US markets to policy shocks in an already fragile environment.

What started as a straightforward tariff announcement unwittingly triggered a systemic risk event, with market conditions deteriorating so rapidly that even hardliners in Trump's team recognized the need to step back from the brink. Suspiciously well-timed options trades ahead of Trump's tariff pause announcement have raised eyebrows, with some traders questioning whether information leaked before the public reversal.

The 90-day window now opens a critical negotiation period that may determine the trajectory of global trade and investment for years to come. **Ray Dalio**, **Jamie Dimon**, and **Larry Summers** have all sounded notes of caution despite the market's relief, recognizing that the fundamental tensions remain unresolved.

<u>**Safe Havens Surge as Investors Hedge Against Trade War Uncertainty**</u>

**Gold surged to an all-time high** as trade war anxiety drove investors toward traditional safe havens. The precious metal benefited from a perfect storm of factors: heightened geopolitical risk, recession fears, and an increasingly unstable bond market. This rush to safety has been amplified by growing anxiety about the resilience of equity markets and broader concerns about the shifting global economic order.

The **Swiss franc hit a decade-high against the dollar**, reinforcing its status as the premier currency safe haven. Meanwhile, the dollar lost ground broadly, reflecting international investors' fading confidence in US assets amid rising political and economic uncertainty.

Even after Trump's tariff pause, these safe haven assets have largely maintained their gains, indicating persistent investor unease about what comes next. Markets appear to be treating the 90-day window as a temporary reprieve rather than a resolution, with many participants using the bounce to reposition portfolios for prolonged volatility.

Interestingly, **Bitcoin jumped over 8% to $81,700** following Trump's tariff pause announcement, suggesting it's increasingly viewed as a systemic hedge alongside traditional safe haven assets – a remarkable evolution for the cryptocurrency's market positioning.

<u>**TCS Q4 Disappoints as BSNL Wind-Down and Tariff Uncertainty Weigh**</u>

**Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** kicked off the IT earnings season with disappointing Q4 results, reporting a **1.7% year-on-year decline in net profit** to ₹12,224 crore. The company announced a final dividend of ₹30 per share but faced multiple headwinds that weighed on performance.

CEO **K. Krithivasan** identified the wind-down of the **BSNL project** as a specific drag on the company's India business, while also acknowledging broader challenges from tariff uncertainties impacting customer decisions, particularly in consumer-facing businesses. Despite these challenges, management highlighted strong order book momentum, with total contract value for the year at $42.7 billion.

The results triggered a wave of analyst downgrades, with multiple brokerages cutting EPS estimates over demand concerns related to global macro uncertainty. **TCS shares** were down in early trade, and the weak results sent ripples through the sector, with **Infosys**, **Wipro** and other IT stocks coming under pressure as their ADRs declined in US trading.

In a notable management change, TCS is bringing in **Aarthi Subramanian** from Tata Sons as Chief Operating Officer, potentially signaling a desire to strengthen operational execution amid challenging market conditions. The company plans to hire **42,000 freshers** in the coming year, but remained unclear on salary hike decisions amid trade tensions.

<u>**Indian Banks Face Margin Squeeze as Lending Rates Fall Faster Than Deposit Costs**</u>

Indian banks are heading into a period of compressed margins as lending rates adjust downward more rapidly than deposit costs. **Bank of Baroda** has already cut lending rates following the RBI's move while keeping its MCLR steady, and **Punjab National Bank (PNB)** reduced its Repo-Linked Lending Rate to 8.85% from 9.10%.

Analysts project a muted Q4 for the banking sector, with soft loan growth and margin pressure cited as key concerns. The coming earnings season will be closely watched for signs of how different banks are navigating this transition. The gap between loan and deposit rates is expected to narrow further in the coming quarters, particularly if the RBI continues its easing cycle.

**Nilesh Shah** has recommended bonds for capital preservation amid current uncertainty, suggesting even the typically bullish investment community recognizes the challenges ahead for the sector. The **RBI's credit enhancement guidelines** are seen as a potential bright spot, with bankers describing them as a "game changer" for both investors and issuers by expanding financing options.

The repo rate could be headed to the **5.25-5.5% range** amid growth fears and global uncertainties, suggesting the pressure on bank margins may persist longer than initially expected as rates normalize from their recent highs.

<u>**Indian Economy Well-Positioned Despite Global Trade Tensions**</u>

Multiple investment strategists are making the case that India remains relatively well-insulated from the escalating US-China trade conflict, potentially emerging as a beneficiary as companies accelerate supply chain diversification.

**Jefferies** is maintaining an overweight position on India, citing five key reasons for optimism despite global headwinds. **Trideep Bhattacharya** argues that India is well-positioned despite global trade jitters, with domestic growth expected to drive performance in FY26. Similarly, **Vikas Khemani** suggests investors should realign portfolios through the current volatile period, expecting improved performance after a quarter of adjustment.

**Nilesh Shah of Envision Capital** emphasized there's "no need to panic," predicting India will become a standout destination over the medium term as its economic fundamentals remain robust. This view is reinforced by **UBS**, which suggests Trump's tariff moves may actually accelerate India's semiconductor manufacturing push as companies seek alternatives to China.

The consensus view seems to be that while India won't be immune to global volatility, its domestically-driven growth story remains intact, with **10-12% earnings growth** still anticipated by analysts like **Varun Goel** for the coming year.

<u>**Pharma Stocks Surge on US Regulatory Approvals**</u>

Indian pharmaceutical companies scored significant regulatory victories in the US market, driving sharp stock price gains across the sector.

**Sun Pharmaceutical** shares rallied 5% after a US court lifted launch restrictions on its autoimmune disorder drug, removing a significant obstacle to the company's growth plans in the specialty pharma segment. The ruling represents a crucial legal victory that should contribute meaningfully to Sun's US revenue stream.

Similarly, **Biocon** shares jumped nearly 6% after its unit received USFDA approval for a cancer biosimilar, strengthening its oncology portfolio. These regulatory wins highlight the growing capabilities of Indian pharma companies in complex, high-margin therapeutic areas beyond traditional generics.

The pharmaceutical sector's strong performance comes at an opportune time, as many investors are seeking defensive positions amid broader market volatility. The combination of regulatory tailwinds and relatively inelastic demand for healthcare products makes these stocks attractive in the current uncertain environment.

<u>**Consumer Sector in Focus as Morgan Stanley Reshuffles Ratings**</u>

**Morgan Stanley** has made significant changes to its consumer sector outlook, upgrading **Godrej Consumer** and **Hindustan Unilever** while downgrading **Dabur**. This analyst repositioning comes as investors increasingly look to consumer stocks for defensive positioning amid global uncertainty.

**Varun Goel** is "betting on FMCG for the next 12-18 months," highlighting the sector's appeal during volatile periods. The relatively inelastic demand for consumer staples provides earnings visibility that becomes increasingly valuable when economic growth is threatened by external shocks.

Consumer companies are also benefiting from moderating input costs, which should support margin expansion after several quarters of pressure. Rural demand recovery, though gradual, is providing an additional tailwind for companies with strong distribution networks in India's hinterland.

**Shibani Sircar Kurian** specifically identified "thrust on consumption" as a key investment theme in the current volatile world, suggesting institutional investors are increasing their allocations to the sector.

<u>**Global Bond Market Turbulence Signals Deeper Concerns**</u>

The US bond market experienced extraordinary volatility this week, sending tremors through global fixed income markets in what one analyst described as "aftershocks from the epicenter." Despite a partial recovery after Trump's tariff pause, the underlying fragility of bond market functioning has become a major concern for investors and policymakers alike.

The violent moves in Treasury yields exposed liquidity issues and structural weaknesses that had been masked by years of relative stability. **Yellen's** admission that bond market turmoil influenced the tariff pause decision underscores just how serious the situation had become – financial stability concerns ultimately trumped the administration's trade policy ambitions.

**Berkshire Hathaway's** yen bond deal came in as its smallest ever amid the trade war turbulence, further evidence of how financing conditions have deteriorated. Meanwhile, corporate credit spreads widened along tariff fault lines, with companies most exposed to US-China trade tensions seeing the largest increases in borrowing costs.

The episode has raised fundamental questions about market resilience in an era of higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and reduced dealer balance sheet capacity. As one market veteran noted, "The creaking US bond market signals danger still lurks," despite the temporary relief from immediate tariff implementation.

<u>**IPO Pipeline Builds as Urban Company Gets Shareholder Approval**</u>

**Urban Company**, the home services platform, has secured shareholder approval for a ₹528 crore fresh issue as part of its upcoming initial public offering. This development adds to the growing pipeline of technology-enabled service companies looking to tap the public markets despite broader volatility.

The company, which connects consumers with service professionals across categories like beauty, home repairs, and cleaning, has shown strong growth in recent years as it expanded across major Indian cities and select international markets. The IPO will provide growth capital while offering early investors a partial exit opportunity.

The timing is notable given current market conditions, suggesting confidence among private companies and their backers that investor appetite for quality businesses remains robust despite external headwinds. Urban Company's move follows successful listings by other tech-enabled platforms that have generally maintained premium valuations post-IPO.

<u>**Corporate Updates: Strategic Moves Amid Market Volatility**</u>

Several companies announced significant strategic initiatives despite the volatile market backdrop:

**Samvardhana Motherson** shares zoomed 6% after announcing a €50 million cost optimization drive, highlighting how companies are proactively addressing operational efficiency amid economic uncertainty. The market's positive reaction demonstrates investor preference for businesses taking decisive action to protect margins.

**Zomato** shares gained attention after liquidating its Netherlands subsidiary, continuing the food delivery giant's strategy of streamlining international operations to focus on its core Indian market. The move aligns with the company's push toward profitability and capital efficiency.

**Alpha Wave** has entered the race for **Carlyle's** 24% stake in **Nxtra** for ₹5,125 crore, signaling continued private equity interest in India's digital infrastructure sector despite global market turmoil. Data center assets remain highly sought after as AI adoption drives exponential growth in computing and storage requirements.

**Tata Steel Netherlands** announced a new program that analysts view positively despite the challenging macro backdrop, focusing on operational improvements to navigate the difficult European steel market.

<u>**Oil Prices Decline on Demand Concerns as Trade War Threatens Growth**</u>

**Oil prices** are set to drop for a second consecutive week as the US-China trade war raises concerns about global energy demand. Brent and WTI crude both fell approximately 3% as investors reassessed the growth outlook in the world's two largest economies.

The price declines came despite the 90-day tariff pause, indicating the market believes trade tensions will persist and potentially escalate after this temporary reprieve. Energy traders are particularly focused on China, where economic momentum was already fragile before this latest trade confrontation.

Interestingly, the oil market's reaction contrasts with equities, which bounced sharply on the tariff delay. This divergence suggests commodity traders are taking a longer-term view of the potential demand destruction from protectionist policies, while equity investors responded more to the immediate relief of avoiding tariffs in the near term.

The broader commodities complex is increasingly pricing in slower global growth, with industrial metals also under pressure despite the temporary de-escalation in trade tensions.

<u>**Stock Picks: Analysts Recommend Defensive Positioning With Selective Growth**</u>

Several brokerages have released trading ideas emphasizing a mix of defensive stocks with select growth opportunities in the current volatile environment:

**Motilal Oswal Financial Services** recommends buying **Gujarat Gas** with a target price of ₹475, highlighting the company's strong market position and relatively stable earnings profile. Meanwhile, **JM Financial** maintains a Buy on **TBO Tek** but has lowered its target price to ₹1,400, balancing growth prospects against broader market uncertainty.

**Apollo Hospitals**, **Dr. Lal Path Labs**, **NBCC**, **HUL**, and **Hindustan Petroleum Corp** feature prominently across multiple recommendation lists, with healthcare and consumer staples particularly well-represented, reflecting analysts' preference for defensives in the current environment.

For more tactical traders, **Tata Motors** and **HPCL** are among the top trading ideas for today, while technical analysts note that stocks like **Narayana Hrudayalaya**, **IndiGo**, and **Chambal Fertilizers** that recently hit 52-week highs present interesting opportunities.

The common thread across these recommendations is a preference for companies with strong balance sheets, visible earnings, and some degree of insulation from global trade tensions.
