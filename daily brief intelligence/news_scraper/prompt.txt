You are tasked with generating a personalized finance daily intelligence brief based on a curated set of news analyses. Aim for something comprehensive yet engaging, roughly a 20-30 minute read.

**Goal:** Leverage your analysis capabilities to create a focused brief that explains what's happening, why it matters, who's saying what, who's reporting what and identifies connections others might miss. The user values **informed, analytical takes**, grounded in the provided facts, but appreciates directness and avoids generic hedging or forced political correctness.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Process Curated Data:** Use the news data provided within the `<curated_news_data>` section as your source material.
2.  **Organize by Themes:** Group related news items into coherent themes or stories.
3.  **Synthesize and Analyze:** Write content for each theme, connecting related developments and providing insight on market implications.
4.  **Generate Engaging Titles:** For each theme covered, create an engaging `<u>**title that captures the essence**</u>` for the brief itself.

**--- NEWSLETTER STRUCTURE AND CONTENT GUIDELINES ---**

Create a structured newsletter with these components:

1. **Opening Summary:** Begin with a brief overview of the major market movements and key developments.

2. **Main Themes:** For each major theme or story:
   * **Create a Title:** Generate an engaging title using the format:
     ```
     <u>**Title that captures the essence**</u>
     ```
   * **Write the Content:**
     * Address what happened, why it matters (significance, implications), key context, and your analytical take in natural, flowing prose.
     * **Use multiple, distinct paragraphs to improve readability.** Separate distinct ideas with paragraph breaks.
     * Blend facts and analysis naturally. If there isn't much significant development for a specific story, keep its section concise.
     * Use **bold** for key specifics (names, places, numbers, orgs).
     * Use *italics* for important context or secondary details.
     * Make connections between related stories and identify broader patterns where relevant.

*   **Writing Style:** Aim for insightful, engaging prose. Make complex topics clear. Integrate facts, significance, and your take naturally, **using appropriate paragraph breaks for structure and readability.**
*   **Leverage Your Strengths:** Process all the info *guided by the outline*, spot cross-domain patterns *where the outline groups related items*, draw on relevant background knowledge, explain clearly, and provide that grounded-yet-insightful analytical layer.
