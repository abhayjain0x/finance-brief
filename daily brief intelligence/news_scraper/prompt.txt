hey, i have a bunch of finance news (in random order) derived from detailed analyses of news from the last 30h. could you give me daily markets intelligence brief? aim for something comprehensive yet engaging, roughly a 30-40 minute read.

some context: i built a system that collects/analyzes/compiles finance news because i was tired of mainstream news that either overwhelms with useless info or misses what actually matters. you're really good at information analysis/writing/etc so i figure by just asking you this i'd get something even better than what presidents get - a focused brief that tells me what's happening, why it matters, and what connections exist that others miss. i value **informed, analytical takes** – even if i don't agree with them, they're intellectually stimulating. i want analysis grounded in the facts provided, free from generic hedging or forced political correctness.

your job: go through all the curated news data i've gathered below. analyze **everything** first to identify what *actually* matters before writing. look for:
- actual significance (not just noise/volume)
- hidden patterns and connections between stories
- important developments flying under the radar
- how separate events might be related
- genuinely interesting or impactful stories

structure the brief using the sections below, making it feel conversational – complete sentences, natural flow, occasional wry commentary where appropriate.

**--- NEWSLETTER STRUCTURE AND CONTENT GUIDELINES ---**

1. **Title:** create a title for the brief. construct it using the main topics. it should be short/punchy/not clickbaity etc. make sure to not use "short text: longer text here for some reason" i HATE it, under no circumstance should there be colons in the title. make sure it's not too vague/generic either bc there might be many stories. maybe don't focus on like restituting what happened in the title, just do like the major entities/actors/things that happened. like "[person A], [thing 1], [org B] & [person O]" etc. try not to use verbs. state topics instead of stating topics + adding "shakes world order". always use lowercase.

2. **what matters now:** Begin with a high condenced summary of the newsletter in 5-6 lines , anyone opening the newsletter should get a very good idea about what matters , what happened in markets .

3. **Main Themes:** For each major theme or story:
   * **Create a Title:** Generate an engaging title using the format:
     ```
     <u>**Title that captures the essence**</u>
     ```
   * **Write the Content:**
     * Address what happened, why it matters (significance, implications), key context, and your analytical take in natural, flowing prose.
     * **Use multiple, distinct paragraphs to improve readability.** Separate distinct ideas with paragraph breaks.
     * Blend facts and analysis naturally. If there isn't much significant development for a specific story, keep its section concise.
     * Use **bold** for key specifics (names, places, numbers, orgs).
     * Use *italics* for important context or secondary details.
     * Make connections between related stories and identify broader patterns where relevant.

give me the brief i couldn't get before ai - one that combines human-like insight with superhuman information processing.

**--- FINAL INSTRUCTIONS ---**

*   Use complete sentences and standard capitalization/grammar.
*   Be direct and analytical, aligning with the persona guided by the system prompt (well-informed, analytical friend with dry wit).
*   **Leverage Your Strengths:** Process all the info *guided by the outline*, spot cross-domain patterns *where the outline groups related items*, draw on relevant background knowledge, explain clearly, and provide that grounded-yet-insightful analytical layer.
*   **writing style:** aim for the tone of an extremely well-informed, analytical friend with a dry wit and access to incredible information processing. be insightful, engaging, and respect my time. make complex topics clear without oversimplifying. integrate facts, significance, and your take naturally.

Generate the final brief based *strictly* on the provided outline and sourced from the curated data.
