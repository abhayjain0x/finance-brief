SUGAR STOCKS (-VE)

Sugar Sector - Cane at a Crossroads: FRP Politics vs. Mill Economics  

1Ô∏è‚É£ FRP Likely to Rise (from ‚Çπ340/quintal), but sugar MSP still frozen at ‚Çπ31/kg since 2019 ‚Üí hurting mill margins.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Squeeze Intensifies: Ethanol production is being curbed to boost sugar supply as stocks hit record lows (~4 MMT). Climate change may hit SY26 yields too.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Mills Under Pressure: Higher input costs + stagnant selling prices = shrinking profits. Only a coordinated FRP-MSP move can ease stress.

üì∞ Govt may soon propose FRP hike for 2025‚Äì26 crushing season
üìå Current FRP: ‚Çπ340/qtl @ 10.25% recovery
üìå Hike under review due to rising input costs & farmer pressure

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Concerns:
‚ñ™Ô∏è Sugar output to fall to ~26 MMT in SY25.
‚ñ™Ô∏è Ethanol from juice/B-molasses may be restricted to ensure sugar availability, in our view.

üìä Impact:
FRP hike = political win & farmer relief ‚úÖ
But without MSP hike = more mill strain ‚ùå

Our View:
Partial reforms = margin pressure on sugar stocks.
UP SAP is already ‚Çπ370/qtl ‚Üí any FRP hike increases pressure to raise SAP too‚Äîunlikely in the current macro situation.

FROM NITIN AWASTHI, INCRED

GoI notches up sugar sector reforms with *Sugar (Control) Order, 2025* ‚Äì a sweeping overhaul replacing the 1966 order.

üîπ *Digital Clampdown: Over 450 mills now integrated via API with govt portal; GSTN-linked data means **real-time tracking* of sugar movement & pricing.
üîπ *Raw & Khandsari Sugar In*: Raw sugar now regulated; khandsari units >500 TCD must pay FRP, adopt digital systems.
üîπ *By-Product Watch*: Molasses, ethanol, bagasse, etc. now tracked ‚Äì controlling diversion, especially for ethanol.
üîπ *Unified Pricing*: 2018 pricing rules merged in ‚Äì one-stop regulation now.
üîπ *FSSAI Standards: All sugar types now **standardized definitions* ‚Äì less ambiguity in trade, higher transparency.

üë• *Stakeholder Impact*:

* *Farmers*: Better FRP assurance, but risk of payment delays due to compliance lag.
* *Mills*: Streamlined ops, but high compliance load & tighter ethanol oversight.
* *Exporters*: Improved data = better planning, but export flexibility may reduce.
* *Govt*: Stronger oversight, but rollout in informal sectors will be tough.

üìå *Bottomline: The sugar sector now runs on **live data, stricter definitions, and tighter control*. From cane to ethanol ‚Äì all eyes are on compliance. No sweet escape anymore.

China says it is evaluating possible US talks on trade

Lots of newsflow in 5 headlines !

1. China feels the White House is ‚Äútoo divided‚Äù on trade policy and will hold off on entering serious trade talks with US while it waits to see which of Trump‚Äôs advisors will have his ear and how other countries respond to the 90 day pause on tariffs.( SCMP)

2. Beijing-backed social media accounts say U.S. officials have reached out to Chinese counterparts through multiple channels to discuss trade, as the world watches for any sign of tariff talks between the two sides. (WSJ)

3. The US & Ukraine signed an agreement over access to the country‚Äôs natural resources. The deal will see the US will get first claim on profits transferred into a jointly managed investment fund that‚Äôs intended in part to reimburse the US for future military assistance. (Bloomberg)

4. Saudi Arabian officials are briefing allies & industry experts to say the kingdom is unwilling to prop up the oil market with further supply cuts & can handle a prolonged period of low prices, five sources with knowledge of the talks said. This possible shift in Saudi policy could suggest a move toward producing more and expanding its market share, a major change after five years spent balancing the market through deep output as a leader of the OPEC+ group of oil producers. (Reuters)

5) Elon Musk said he‚Äôs considering sending DOGE to the Fed, citing a costly renovation of its headquarters as an example of potential government waste. (Bloomberg)
