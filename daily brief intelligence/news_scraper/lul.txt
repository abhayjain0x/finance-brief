**Reading Today - Entero Healthcare**

📌The combined market share for the large/national healthcare product distributors in India is only 8-10% vs 90-95% in developed markets

📌In case, you haven't heard of healthcare product distribution business, here is a short description of what Entero does and that should give you an idea of how this business works. 

📌Entero distributes 76,600+ products (medicines, medical devices etc...) from 2,500+ healthcare product manufacturers to 86,200+ retail pharmacies and 3,200+ hospitals, across 45 Indian cities in 20 states. They do this thru the 104 warehouses that they have across the country.

📌Now, coming back to the market share discussion, the fact is, this combined market share for the large healthcare product distributors in India has already improved from 3-5% in 2015 to 8-10% currently, and their market share is expected to increase to 20-30% by FY28.

📌An estimate suggests that Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) is more than 40% of total health expenditure in India and medicines account for half of it.

📌The TAM for healthcare distribution market is a jaw dropping INR 3.3 trillion and it is estimated to grow at 10-11% CAGR for next many years.

📌Now, when we realize, Entero’s current market share in this prized healthcare distribution market is only at 1.5%, we know that this should be a long lasting game!

📌That's why Entero is focused on M&A. They have done more than 40 deals so far and IPO money should be useful for continuing  the game. The good thing is, Entero is still doing acquisitions at 5-8X EV/EBITDA multiples.

📌Current estimate suggests that Entero's market share may reach 2.8% by FY30. You might think, "oh, this is not even double" but then remember, the TAM also growing at 10-11% CAGR!

📌But the downside of this heave acquisition spree is, negative FCF. Lack of cashflows could always hurt, I personally think, this is okay in this case until Entero achieves certain strength. 

📌Both margins and working capital days are critical to turn from a negative operating cash flow to positive operating cash flow.

📌If you notice, the margins have started improving and showing upward journey and same goes for working capital cycle that's also below 70 now. 

📌Assuming the company can maintain working capital of 60-65 days and achieve 5% EBITDA margins in the next few quarters, this could potentially be a 20% - 25% ROCE business.

Net-net, we are talking about a business that has a long lasting need, has a large TAM that keeps growing in double digits and lot of structural consolidation to be done. This is a long game!

But the valuations aren't necessarily attractive. So, how much price one wants to pay is an individual choice.

Disc: Have tracking quantity. Not a BUY or SELL recommendation.

GoI recently increased the subsidy rates on SSP fertilizer by 42% from INR 5,121/MT to 7,263/MT for FY26.
It should more than offset the increase in prices of Sulphur & rock phosphate (key RM for SSP fertilizer) & should be beneficial for SSP producers like Shree Pushkar. 
They are also doing expansion of 1.5 lakh MT in the fertilizer segment  which should start operation by Q1-Q2 FY26 and should add 400 crs. to topline at 65-70% utilization in the first year.
Furthermore, in the months of Jan'25 & Feb'25, production of SSP fertilizer was up by 32%.

India’s ₹1.5 Lakh Crore Chip Bet: How to Ride the Semiconductor Gold Rush**

India is making a bold **$18 billion (₹1.5 lakh crore)** move to become a global chip-making giant.

And **Gujarat is leading the charge**, attracting **80% of these investments**.

This is more than a tech push—it’s a race for **digital sovereignty**.

With up to **75% capital subsidy** on chip fabs and ATMP units, India is laying the foundation for the next trillion-dollar tech ecosystem.

**Here are 4 stocks that could ride this wave:
**
**1. Tata Elxsi
**
• Key exposure to semiconductor R&D
• Plays across EVs, 5G, MedTech, and autonomous systems

**2. SPEL Semiconductor & Moschip Technologies
**
• Rare pure-play chip players in India
• Early movers in backend manufacturing and IoT chip design

**3. Dixon Technologies
**
• EMS giant with deep links in consumer electronics and telecom
• Big beneficiary of chip localization and PLI schemes

**4. HCL Tech & KPIT Tech
**
• Leaders in embedded systems and auto-electronics engineering
• KPIT is riding the automotive software and mobility wave

**Why this matters:
**
India **imports 90%+ of its semiconductors**.
But this isn’t just about reducing dependence—it’s about building **strategic control over the digital future**.

**The next global powerhouses will be built on silicon.
**
India just entered the game.**
