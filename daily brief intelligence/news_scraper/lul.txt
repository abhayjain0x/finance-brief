*Brokerages on RBI Draft Gold lending Norms*

*Nuvama*
RBI‚Äôs new draft gold finance norms will be negative for growth
Though they are less strict than feared
LTV definition has been tightened more for NBFCs than banks
LTV of 75% or less will need to be maintained through the loan life, failing which there will be a penalty
This rule already exists for banks, but is new for NBFCs
Income generation loans need not be shown as gold loans, but to be classified as per business use
The new norms will impact loan growth for NBFCs more than banks
Muthoot stands most impacted

*MS*
Revised LTV definition for bullet loans could affect loan growth
This could be offset by the countercyclical nature of the segment
Monthly interest servicing not being mandated and rollover of bullet loans being allowed once interest is paid at maturity are better outcomes than feared
Muthoot's countercyclical business could still ensure strong earnings vs. other NBFCs
Estimate ROE of 20% and 18% even if AUM is flat in FY26 and FY27 for Muthoot
Muthoot stock could be under pressure in the near term
Manappuram stock is better placed given Bain's open offer price

*Macquarie*
Draft gold lending norms more punitive for NBFCs
For bullet repayment loans LTV should be computed on the total payment
Believe the impact of this will reduce the effective LTV of the product given the buffers required
Believe a separate collateral requirement could affect potential demand
Believe banks currently follow most of the regulations
The potential impact here will be larger for NBFCs

The 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump has notable implications for India's auto component industry:

Positive Impacts:
Market Opportunity in the U.S.: The pause provides Indian manufacturers a chance to expand their market share in the U.S., especially as competitors like China face a 125% tariff. This could benefit Indian exporters of components such as engines, transmissions, and EV parts.

EV Component Growth: With reduced tariffs on critical minerals and lithium-ion cells, Indian manufacturers can access cheaper inputs, potentially boosting domestic EV production and exports.

Challenges:
Existing Tariffs: Despite the pause, a 10% baseline tariff remains on exports to the U.S., while India itself faces a 26% tariff, impacting cost competitiveness.

Supply Chain Risks: Increased imports of subsidized components from China could disrupt local supply chains and reduce incentives for domestic production.

Dependency on Exports to Other Nations: A decline in vehicle exports from countries like Germany and Japan to the U.S. may reduce demand for Indian components supplied to these automakers.

Strategic Responses Needed:
Strengthening supply chain localization to reduce dependency on imports.

Leveraging government incentives like the PLI scheme to enhance competitiveness.

Diversifying exports to other North American markets, such as Canada and Mexico.

While the tariff pause offers temporary relief and opportunities, long-term growth will depend on strategic planning and policy support.

Industry-wise impact of Trump's 90-day tariff pause on India:

1. Electronics
The Indian electronics industry is optimistic about attracting manufacturing investments as companies look to diversify from China, which now faces a 125% tariff on exports to the U.S..

2. Shrimp and Seafood
Shrimp exporters, previously disadvantaged by a 26% tariff, welcome the pause, as it levels the playing field with competitors like Ecuador. This provides relief and an opportunity to boost exports.

3. Textiles
Textile manufacturers see potential benefits from importing affordable yarns from China and increasing garment exports to the U.S., leveraging reduced costs.

4. Aluminium
Indian aluminium producers are monitoring trade flows but remain cautious about potential dumping from China and the Middle East. The sector is not directly affected by the tariff pause but continues to face pre-existing U.S. levies.

5. Gems and Jewellery
With $9 billion worth of exports impacted by earlier tariffs, the pause offers temporary relief, allowing exporters to stabilize operations and reassess strategies.

6. Steel
Steel exports remain marginally impacted, as they account for a small percentage of India's total shipments. However, concerns over dumping persist.

The tariff pause provides temporary relief across sectors but leaves uncertainties about long-term trade dynamics and potential dumping risks.

**Deepak Nitrate CAPEX**

Speciality chemicals player Deepak Nitrite's subsidiary Deepak Chem Tech will be investing Rs 3,500 crore, raised through a mix of debt and equity, to set up a manufacturing complex to produce phenol and other solvents used in the production of other chemicals, a company statement said on April 9, aiming to reduce India's reliance on imports.

The board of Deepak Chem Tech (DCTL) also approved plans to set up a multi-purpose manufacturing facility at a capital outlay of around Rs 220 crore for speciality flouro chemicals.
The facility is aiming to produce 185 KTA (kilo tonnes per annum) of acetone, alongside 300 KTA of phenol and 100 KTA of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). 

The proposed capacity for Phenol and Acetone at Deepak Chem will be nearly doubled after the addition, said the company. The existing capacity utilization has been running at 100% in these categories. The new capacity of Phenol and Acetone would be ultimately integrated to produce Polycarbonate Resins (PC), the company said.

The additional capacity for Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenol and Acetone will be put in place over three years, said the company. India's current demand for Acetone is met through imports, and the additional capacity is expected to address the growing segment. The expansion by Deepak Nitrite aligns with the trend of rising domestic demand for acetone, which is used pharma sector as well as paints, adhesives and plastic industry.

Deepak Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director of¬†Deepak Nitrite¬†said, "Deepak Group is committed to create one of the most integrated capacities, which will give it great resilience and strength that is a must in current times. The products being import substitute, will increase our Group's contribution towards Atmanirbharata and the path of Vikshit Bharat."

The decision by Deepak Nitrite shows domestic chemicals players increasing capacity within India, in an effort to substitute imports of these chemicals. Deepak Tech has already signed agreements to acquire and shift a PC plant from Germany to India.

Deepak Nitrite's move is a clear indicator that at least some domestic firms are actively preparing to meet the rising need. The company has plans for the polymer value chain, and the polycarbonate resin (PC) production, where India is entirely import dependent. However, the nation has turned largely self-reliant in phenol, acetone and IPA's production.

"This strategy is further accretive by ensuring that existing capacities are localized without adding to global production. While we work with our collaborators to ensure that European demand for resins is also catered to by this asset. All major polymer projects are expected to be commissioned by December 2027," CEO Maulik Mehta had said in February 2025.
