*Brokerages on RBI Draft Gold lending Norms*

*Nuvama*
RBI’s new draft gold finance norms will be negative for growth
Though they are less strict than feared
LTV definition has been tightened more for NBFCs than banks
LTV of 75% or less will need to be maintained through the loan life, failing which there will be a penalty
This rule already exists for banks, but is new for NBFCs
Income generation loans need not be shown as gold loans, but to be classified as per business use
The new norms will impact loan growth for NBFCs more than banks
Muthoot stands most impacted

*MS*
Revised LTV definition for bullet loans could affect loan growth
This could be offset by the countercyclical nature of the segment
Monthly interest servicing not being mandated and rollover of bullet loans being allowed once interest is paid at maturity are better outcomes than feared
Muthoot's countercyclical business could still ensure strong earnings vs. other NBFCs
Estimate ROE of 20% and 18% even if AUM is flat in FY26 and FY27 for Muthoot
Muthoot stock could be under pressure in the near term
Manappuram stock is better placed given Bain's open offer price

*Macquarie*
Draft gold lending norms more punitive for NBFCs
For bullet repayment loans LTV should be computed on the total payment
Believe the impact of this will reduce the effective LTV of the product given the buffers required
Believe a separate collateral requirement could affect potential demand
Believe banks currently follow most of the regulations
The potential impact here will be larger for NBFCs

*CLSA*
Relief That Bullet Loans & Renewals Are Not Discontinued
RBI’s LTV Caps May Hinder Loan Growth, But Earnings Remain Protected For Muthoot & Manappuram

BI’s draft guidelines on gold loans potentially reduce maximum LTV for gold loan NBFCs, increase competition from moneylenders and/or reduce IRR on loans
While await seeing final form, are moderating growth & margin assumptions
Remain constructive on gold loan business, but expect an overhang of regulatory changes to temper stock performance

*CLSA on Tyre Cos*

The 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump has notable implications for India's auto component industry:

Positive Impacts:
Market Opportunity in the U.S.: The pause provides Indian manufacturers a chance to expand their market share in the U.S., especially as competitors like China face a 125% tariff. This could benefit Indian exporters of components such as engines, transmissions, and EV parts.

EV Component Growth: With reduced tariffs on critical minerals and lithium-ion cells, Indian manufacturers can access cheaper inputs, potentially boosting domestic EV production and exports.

Challenges:
Existing Tariffs: Despite the pause, a 10% baseline tariff remains on exports to the U.S., while India itself faces a 26% tariff, impacting cost competitiveness.

Supply Chain Risks: Increased imports of subsidized components from China could disrupt local supply chains and reduce incentives for domestic production.

Dependency on Exports to Other Nations: A decline in vehicle exports from countries like Germany and Japan to the U.S. may reduce demand for Indian components supplied to these automakers.

Strategic Responses Needed:
Strengthening supply chain localization to reduce dependency on imports.

Leveraging government incentives like the PLI scheme to enhance competitiveness.

Diversifying exports to other North American markets, such as Canada and Mexico.

While the tariff pause offers temporary relief and opportunities, long-term growth will depend on strategic planning and policy support.

Industry-wise impact of Trump's 90-day tariff pause on India:

1. Electronics
The Indian electronics industry is optimistic about attracting manufacturing investments as companies look to diversify from China, which now faces a 125% tariff on exports to the U.S..

2. Shrimp and Seafood
Shrimp exporters, previously disadvantaged by a 26% tariff, welcome the pause, as it levels the playing field with competitors like Ecuador. This provides relief and an opportunity to boost exports.

3. Textiles
Textile manufacturers see potential benefits from importing affordable yarns from China and increasing garment exports to the U.S., leveraging reduced costs.

4. Aluminium
Indian aluminium producers are monitoring trade flows but remain cautious about potential dumping from China and the Middle East. The sector is not directly affected by the tariff pause but continues to face pre-existing U.S. levies.

5. Gems and Jewellery
With $9 billion worth of exports impacted by earlier tariffs, the pause offers temporary relief, allowing exporters to stabilize operations and reassess strategies.

6. Steel
Steel exports remain marginally impacted, as they account for a small percentage of India's total shipments. However, concerns over dumping persist.

The tariff pause provides temporary relief across sectors but leaves uncertainties about long-term trade dynamics and potential dumping risks.

Jefferies India Strategy

Amidst global uncertainties, absolute index performance is difficult to predict

But India should emerge as a relative outperformed

5 reasons to Overweight India –
Lesser dependence to US & China demand
Relatively lower tariff incidence
Lower oil prices
Low FPI weights
A pro-growth RBI stance

Remain hopeful that the hard stance taken by the US on tariffs would eventually soften

Believe that the weaker economic trend in the US and China would still be our base case

Increase Underweight stance on IT and metals

Add NTPC on power demand improving and BPCL on beneficiary of lower oil prices to portfolio

Remove the listed part of Siemens from our portfolio as its non-power, along with Hindalco and Coforge

Macquarie on RBI Draft Gold lending Norms

Draft gold lending norms more punitive for NBFCs

For bullet repayment loans LTV should be computed on the total payment

Believe the impact of this will reduce the effective LTV of the product given the buffers required

Believe a separate collateral requirement could affect potential demand

Believe banks currently follow most of the regulations

The potential impact here will be larger for NBFCs

Jefferies on Sun Pharma 

Maintain Buy with TP of Rs 2265

Injunction for hair loss drug LEQSELVI lifted in US, paves the way for a launch

The preliminary injunction had delayed Sun's launch despite a US FDA approval

Preliminary injunction is no longer in effect and hence the company is no longer under a court order that delays or restricts it from launching LEQSELVI

Sun will disclose LEQSELVI launch plans in due course of time

Believe this ruling clears a major roadblock for Sun

Estimate sales of $50-70m in FY27 or ~3-5% of Sun's global specialty sales
