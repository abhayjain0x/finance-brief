Some recent global Opinion on India

India as a safe harbour - HSBC Asset Management
India stocks have gained slightly since the ‘liberation day’ tariffs were announced. With India still exhibiting world leading GDP and earnings growth, and valuations having corrected over recent months, the case for the country’s equities in the face of global challenges is compelling 

Goldman Sachs AM
Increasing the allocation to India within an Emerging Markets portfolio, there can be potential enhancements to the information ratio by achieving higher annualized excess returns without significantly increasing return volatility 

Jefferies Greed and Fear
With US stocks still trading at 19.2x forward earnings, global investors should continue to reduce positions in favour of Europe, China and India.

India’s MedTech Innovation Moat - Polymed 

- India’s medical device market is set to triple from $11B → $30B in 5 years
- How IP (like Polymed’s 334 patents) becomes the ultimate defense
- Export-led IP-driven models investors love, dont miss this study.

🔹~70% of Polymed's revenue from exports
🔹Europe & RoW growing at ~30% YoY
🔹India still underpenetrated (1/3rd hospitals covered)
 Dual-engine model: Domestic catch-up + global scale

2️⃣ US Tariffs = India’s Opportunity
 With existing and potential new tariffs on Chinese medtech supplies, Indian players like Polymed stand to benefit as global buyers diversify sourcing
🔹Strong quality
🔹Regulatory-compliant
🔹Cost-competitive
US revs may kick off in FY27+, riding this realignment

3️⃣ Moat in Motion
Entry Barriers:
🔹334 patents
🔹50+ new SKUs in pipeline
🔹3 mega plants coming online
New verticals (Renal, Cardio, Oncology) = margin expansion

4️⃣ Smart Compounder Playbook
🔹Net Cash: ₹1,074 Cr
🔹FX advantage (open exposure, net exporter)
🔹~28 - 30% PAT growth
🔹ROCE: 23.9%
📌 Strong balance sheet + product depth + global tailwinds = underappreciated compounder

JM FINANCIAL ON BHEL

Disappointing execution; Hope hinges on margins

Provisional unaudited revenue of INR 27.35bn for FY25, 19% YoY, -9% JMFe

This translates into 4QFY25 revenue of INR 80 bn, -3% YoY.

Emkay On Devyani Int

Upgrades Devyani to BUY from Add

Tgt raised by ~18% to Rs200 from Rs170

Upgrade is led by potential value creation in the likely acquisition of `Biryani By Kilo' (BBK) and possible return of a mid-teen growth for the India business in FY26E (vs 7% in FY25). 

Devyani’s operational excellence grants conviction on BBK’s margin turnaround

Growth potential healthy in a large unorganized biryani market

Devyani should see return of mid-teens organic growth in FY26

AXIS CAP ON ADANI PORTS ACTIVE

Non-cash ~USD 2.5 bn deal to acquire NQXT boosts FY25 pro-forma consolidated ADSEZ port volumes by 7.8%, EBITDA by 7%, EBIT by 5%, net-debt by 11.6%, and net-debt/EBITDA slightly (by ~10 bps) to 2.2x. 

The deal is RoCE-dilutive (post-deal RoCE down 130-150 bps through FY27E) and EPS-dilutive (by 2%-3% through FY27).

We expect initial stock reaction to the deal to be negative

NUVAMA ON ADANI PORT ACQUISITION 

NQXT acquisition shall lead to i) 6–7% addition to APSEZ’s consolidated volume/revenue/EBITDA in FY26 (4% at PAT level); 

2% EPS dilution in FY26 (APSEZ estimates accretion second year onwards)

~200bp impact on pre-tax RoCE/RoIC; and iv) no material impact on net debt/EBITDA profile (~2.1x)

Bernstein on Infosys

Cuts Target Price To INR 1,680 vs 1,780 Earlier 

Cut our FY26/FY27 EPS by -4.0%/-4.4% to account for softer FY26 revenue guidance

Weak exit rate from FY25 may make achieving upper end of the revenue range challenging

Nuvama on ICICI Bank

Revise TP to INR1,630/3.2x BV FY26E from INR1,470

Strong beat on NIM, PAT and asset quality

Asset quality in business banking is turning out to be better-than-expected despite high growth because the bank focused on the better-rated borrowers in this segment, does not lend at very high yields and has invested in sound credit models

AXIS CAP ON LUPIN

Lupin is likely to get final approval for gJynarque (tolvaptan; USD1.6bn) by 23 Apr 2025 when the exclusivity expires, followed by an immediate launch with 180-day sole exclusivity

Tolvaptan to be a USD 200mn+ opportunity for LPC in FY26 with further upside potential

Revise our FY26 EBITDA/PAT by 8%/10%

UBS on Infosys 

Price target reduces to Rs1,850 (vs Rs2,100 earlier) 

Cut our earnings estimates on softer-than-expected Q4 revenue growth

Unlike FY25, it's missing large deals ramp up with higher macros uncertainty than in 2024

Management guided for organic revenue growth of 0-3% YoY cc suggesting a CQGR of ~1.8-1.9% on the upper end, looks like an uphill task

Axis Cap on HDFC Bank

Maintain BUY but raise our SOTP based TP to Rs 2,205 (from Rs 2,000)

Increase our FY27E PAT estimates by ~10% as we build in slightly higher margins

Gross slippage declined 15% QoQ to Rs 75 bn (1.2% of loans vs 1.4% in Q3FY25)

Net branch addition highest in last four qtrs, employee count increases QoQ
