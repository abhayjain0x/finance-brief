UBS Group AG is abandoning its long-held bearish view on Indian stocks, upgrading the market to neutral from underweight as it realigns its strategy given global trade uncertainties. 
The brokerage is becoming more optimistic on the South Asian market amid a growing preference for defensive and domestically-oriented shares, strategists including Sunil Tirumalai wrote in a note dated Thursday.

‚ÄúWhile valuations still look expensive relative to ordinary fundamental performance of companies, India screens as defensive amidst trade uncertainty given its domestic focused economy, while benefiting from lower crude oil prices,‚Äù the analysts wrote.

SYNGENE down 10% after Big Guidance Miss 

Syngene - FY26 guidance significantly below expectations, likely 25% Ebitda cuts for FY26

After a tepid FY25 with overall revenue growth of 2% cc and 4% in INR terms, Syngene has guided for FY26 revenue growth of mid-single-digits (base biz growth of early teens to be offset by inventory destocking likely in Librela).

Consensus was building 15% INR revenue growth in FY26 vs mgmt guidance of mid-single-digits now. So most likely there will be 8-10% cuts to FY26 revenue estimates.
