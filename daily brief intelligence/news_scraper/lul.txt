üîπ Overall Verdict: Mixed
‚û§ Strong sequential growth, but decline compared to last year.

‚û§ QoQ growth was supported by a marginal uptick in gas volumes and price realizations. Seasonality in demand (end of winter quarter) and gradual pickup in industrial activity aided revenue.

üîπ Profitability Insights
‚û§ EBITDA margins were under pressure due to higher input gas costs. Share of JV profits improved sequentially (‚Çπ6.19 crore vs ‚Çπ1.07 crore QoQ). However, YoY profits fell, reflecting margin compression.

üîπ Cost & Efficiency
‚û§ Cost of natural gas rose sharply, keeping overall expenses higher.
‚û§ Operating Profit Margin (OPM) moderated vs last year.
‚û§ Employee costs and finance costs remained stable QoQ.
‚û§ Depreciation increased YoY, reflecting continuous capex buildup.

üîπ Strategic / Operational Highlights
‚û§ Dividend of ‚Çπ0.25/share announced.
‚û§ Ongoing expansion in newly authorized geographical areas (e.g., Jalandhar GA).
‚û§ Continued progress despite pending regulatory matters (e.g., PNGRB disputes).

Global - China dumping on Indian industry

India must be strategically cautious and focus on trade agreements like BTAs (Bilateral Trade Agreements), particularly with the US.

The supply chain crisis is more urgent than service agreements. BTAs should prioritize goods and reciprocal tariff issues.

India is benefiting modestly from the US-China tariff war, with US importers looking to India to reduce dependency on China.

India needs to improve competitiveness by addressing internal hurdles (infrastructure, cost of finance).

Emphasis on regional trade integration and building trust through sustained performance.

India could benefit from global firms‚Äô China+1 strategy, especially in sectors like engineering goods.
