# THE DAILY BRIEF

### trump's tariff wars, dollar's decline & the corporate earnings season

## what matters now

Trump roiled global markets with aggressive trade tariffs, then partially walked back his stance with a 90-day pause that excludes China—whipsaw moves that triggered a historic S&P 500 rally followed by sharp declines. The dollar plummeted to decade lows against safe-haven currencies as investors lost confidence in U.S. assets. In India, TCS kicked off the earnings season with a 1.7% profit decline, setting a cautious tone as U.S. trade tensions threaten the broader IT sector. The RBI continues its shift toward accommodative monetary policy as U.S. trade policy introduces new uncertainties to the global economy.

<u>**global economic whiplash: trump's haphazard tariffs and partial retreat**</u>

The global economy experienced extraordinary volatility this week as Trump imposed, then partially reversed, sweeping tariff hikes. After implementing a blanket 10% tariff across most imports and raising China-specific duties to 145%, Trump unexpectedly announced a 90-day pause for most trading partners—though conspicuously excluding China. This incoherent approach sent markets on a wild ride, with the S&P 500 surging 9.5% in its third-best day since 1940 before plummeting 3.5% the following day.

Former Treasury Secretary **Janet Yellen** linked the partial retreat directly to bond market instability, noting that falling Treasury prices raised concerns about financial system stability. The "bond vigilantes" finally flexed their muscles, suggesting even Trump's administration has limits when confronted with a potential liquidity crisis. **Goldman Sachs** revised its U.S. recession probability from 65% to 45%, still signaling significant risk despite the tariff pause.

The impacts are already visible in global trade patterns. Chinese sellers on **Amazon** are planning to raise prices by up to 30% or abandon the U.S. market entirely. Major companies like **Audi** halted U.S. shipments, while **Nintendo** postponed Switch 2 pre-orders. This disruption occurs despite Trump's claims that his tariff strategy is merely negotiating leverage—a position that increasingly resembles economic brinkmanship with few apparent benefits.

Perhaps most concerning is the lasting damage to economic predictability. As **William Reinsch**, a former U.S. trade official, noted, Trump's approach introduces a degree of unpredictability that makes business planning nearly impossible. The administration's willingness to wildly swing between extreme positions in a matter of days leaves both allies and adversaries questioning America's reliability as an economic partner.

<u>**dollar in distress as global investors flee to safe havens**</u>

The U.S. dollar plummeted to a decade-low against the Swiss franc and hit multi-year lows against other safe haven currencies, signaling a dramatic shift in global investor sentiment. The greenback fell 1.2% to 0.81405 Swiss francs and dropped 0.9% against the Japanese yen, marking its weakest level since October. This flight from dollar-denominated assets has simultaneously driven gold prices to an all-time high of $3,219.23 per ounce.

This isn't just routine currency fluctuation—it represents a fundamental reevaluation of America's standing in the global financial system. Market analysts noted a pronounced "sell U.S." sentiment as foreign investors rebalanced portfolios in reaction to Trump's erratic trade policies. The selling pressure extended beyond currencies to U.S. Treasury bonds, where yields on long-dated securities spiked to their highest levels since 2001, reflecting diminished foreign appetite for American debt.

*The yuan also hit its weakest level against the dollar since December 2007 before recovering slightly. This movement suggests China's central bank is navigating a careful balance—allowing gradual depreciation to offset tariff impacts while preventing uncontrolled capital outflows that could destabilize financial markets.*

For investors, this currency instability introduces new complications. Companies with dollar-denominated debt face rising repayment costs, while international trade calculations become increasingly complex. The broader implication is that America's long-standing role as the world's default financial safe haven is under unprecedented stress—a development that could have profound long-term consequences for global capital flows if confidence doesn't recover.

<u>**tcs disappoints as q4 tech results potentially signal sector trouble**</u>

**TCS** kicked off India's Q4 earnings season with disappointing results that may foreshadow broader challenges for the IT sector. The company reported a 1.7% year-on-year decline in net profit to ₹12,224 crore, missing analyst expectations of ₹12,650 crore. Revenue grew 5.3% to ₹64,479 crore, but still fell short of forecasts. Following the results, multiple brokerages cut price targets, though most maintained "buy" ratings based on TCS's strong order book and long-term prospects.

CEO **K Krithivasan** blamed the weak performance on delayed decision-making due to tariff discussions impacting market sentiment. "The retail, consumer packaged goods, travel, and hospitality sectors remain significantly impacted, while demand in Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance has remained stable," he explained. This sector-specific weakness likely reflects clients' uncertainty about economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. market.

In a significant management change, TCS appointed **Aarthi Subramanian** as President and Chief Operating Officer, bringing her over from Tata Sons where she served as Group Chief Digital Officer. This move suggests TCS is reinforcing its leadership team to navigate challenging market conditions.

Looking ahead, **Infosys** will report Q4 results on April 17, providing another crucial data point on the IT sector's health. BNP Paribas maintains "buy" ratings on both TCS and Infosys despite projected flat revenue growth for the Indian IT industry in FY2026. Their analysis suggests earnings estimates for FY2026-27 have been revised downward by 4-11%, with target prices adjusted by 4-18% to reflect weaker demand conditions.

The broader concern for the sector is whether U.S. tariffs will trigger the recession many analysts now fear, further suppressing IT spending. While the global IT services industry has historically outperformed U.S. real GDP growth, with no year-over-year decline recorded since 1992, the current economic conditions present unprecedented challenges.

<u>**rbi's shift to accommodative policy amid global economic tremors**</u>

The Reserve Bank of India has pivoted significantly toward accommodative monetary policy, lowering its growth forecast for FY26 to 6.5% and revising its inflation target down to 4%. This stance shift came alongside a 25 basis point repo rate cut to 6%, representing the second consecutive reduction. Economists now anticipate a terminal repo rate as low as 5% by December 2025, with some predicting 100 basis points in cuts by year's end.

This policy adjustment is already trickling through the financial system. **Bank of Baroda** reduced its external benchmark-linked lending rates by 25 basis points, though it maintained its Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) at 9%. The challenge for banks now becomes managing the gap between loan and deposit rates—approximately 60% of loans across commercial banks are pegged to external benchmarks, meaning their rates adjust immediately while deposits reprice more slowly. 

*The RBI's credit enhancement guidelines may prove particularly significant for infrastructure financing. By raising the maximum allowable Partial Credit Enhancement from 20% to 50% of bond issuance, companies can improve their credit ratings and reduce borrowing costs. This could channel more than ₹110 lakh crore from pension and insurance funds into infrastructure investments.*

Analysts from **Emkay Global** project a cumulative impact of 7-20 basis points on bank margins from the rate cuts, with ICRA forecasting a 15-17 basis point decrease in net interest margins over the next fiscal year. While this presents short-term challenges for bank profitability, the broader economic stimulus may offset these pressures if it successfully boosts credit demand.

The shift toward accommodation comes at a critical moment as India navigates not only domestic growth concerns but also the potential fallout from escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. **Moody's** has already cut India's GDP forecast for 2025 from 6.4% to 6.1%, citing anticipated tariff impacts on sectors including gems and jewelry, medical devices, and textiles.

<u>**sun pharma and biocon secure key regulatory wins in u.s. pharmaceutical market**</u>

In notable pharmaceutical developments, **Sun Pharma** received a favorable ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which vacated a preliminary injunction that had blocked the company from launching LEQSELVI (deuruxolitinib), a treatment for severe alopecia areata. The court decision followed oral arguments on April 9th and enables Sun Pharma to proceed with its U.S. market entry despite ongoing patent litigation with **Incyte Corporation**.

The market response was immediate, with Sun Pharma shares rallying 5% to reach ₹1,735.80. This positive development comes at a crucial time for the company, whose stock had declined 14% over the past six months despite gaining 63% over the last two years. Analysts maintain "buy" ratings on Sun Pharma, forecasting a 24% upside with an average target price of ₹2,054.

Simultaneously, **Biocon Biologics** secured U.S. FDA approval for Jobevne (bevacizumab-nwgd), a biosimilar to Avastin used in treating multiple cancer types. This represents Biocon's seventh biosimilar approved in the U.S. market, strengthening its oncology portfolio. The approval is particularly significant given that bevacizumab generated approximately $2 billion in U.S. sales in 2023, highlighting the commercial potential for Biocon's offering.

These regulatory victories underscore the growing capabilities of Indian pharmaceutical companies in navigating complex approval processes and competing effectively in the highly regulated U.S. market. They also come against the backdrop of potential trade tensions that could impact the pharmaceutical sector, making the timing of these approvals particularly valuable for both companies' market positions.

<u>**prada's $1.38 billion versace acquisition reshapes luxury landscape**</u>

In a landmark transaction that redefines the luxury fashion industry, **Prada SpA** has acquired **Versace** for $1.38 billion, creating Italy's largest fashion conglomerate. The deal marks the most significant acquisition in Prada's 112-year history and signifies Versace's return to Italian ownership after being purchased by **Capri Holdings** for $2 billion in 2018. The final price might adjust based on Versace's working capital and net debt at closing, expected in the second half of this fiscal year.

This strategic move positions Prada more competitively against luxury powerhouses like **LVMH** and **Kering SA**. For Versace, which struggled to achieve its full potential under Capri's management, the acquisition offers a chance for revitalization under experienced Italian ownership. Prada CEO **Andrea Guerra** emphasized that Versace would complement the group's existing portfolio, introducing diversity and strengthening its market presence.

*The timing is particularly notable given the current global market turbulence. While luxury brands have generally weathered economic uncertainties better than mass-market retailers, executing such a large acquisition amid trade tensions demonstrates Prada's confidence in long-term industry fundamentals.*

The transaction also reflects an important generational transition within Prada itself, as **Lorenzo Bertelli**, son of founders Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, reportedly played a key role in the acquisition strategy. This suggests a forward-looking vision for the consolidated group, leveraging Prada's successful experience with its **Miu Miu** brand to potentially rejuvenate Versace and appeal to younger demographics.

Analysts expect the combined entity to benefit from operational synergies and enhanced market positioning, particularly in targeting the evolving preferences of luxury consumers globally. The acquisition represents not just a business transaction but a significant cultural moment for Italian fashion, bringing one of its most iconic brands back under domestic control.

<u>**market watch: what to expect in the days ahead**</u>

Looking toward the next market session, **GIFT Nifty** is up 460 points to 22,954, indicating a gap-up start for Indian markets. This optimism follows the U.S. tariff pause that temporarily alleviated global trade concerns. The **RBI's** recent rate cut and shift to an accommodative stance further supports this positive sentiment.

For investors cautiously navigating this volatile environment, **Axis Securities** suggests flexicap funds may outperform as market stability returns. These funds, typically biased toward large-caps during volatility, may shift toward mid and small-caps as conditions improve. Meanwhile, **Motilal Oswal** recommends Dr. Lal PathLabs, Godrej Consumer Products, HPCL, Tata Motors, BEML, and Deepak Fertilisers as promising short-term trades.

The technology sector deserves particular attention as earnings season unfolds. Following **TCS's** disappointing results, investors should watch how other IT companies navigate the challenging global environment. **Infosys** reports on April 17, potentially providing further insight into sector-wide trends.

In terms of global influences, the U.S. bond market remains a critical indicator to monitor. Despite some stabilization, Treasury yields have experienced their largest weekly increase since the early 2000s. The functioning of this $29 trillion market is fundamental to global financial stability, with recent liquidity concerns prompting speculation about potential Federal Reserve intervention if conditions deteriorate.

*The cryptocurrency market has shown surprising resilience, with Bitcoin jumping over 8% to $81,700 following Trump's tariff announcement. This movement, along with the 12% gains in Ethereum and XRP, suggests that digital assets are increasingly viewed as potential safe havens during periods of fiat currency volatility.*

As trade negotiations progress during the 90-day tariff pause, commerce minister **Piyush Goyal** has cautioned Indian exporters against becoming conduits for tariff evasion by other countries facing higher U.S. duties. This warning highlights the complex new reality of global trade, where differential tariff rates (104% for China versus 26% for India) create incentives for rulebook manipulation that could expose Indian companies to U.S. sanctions.
