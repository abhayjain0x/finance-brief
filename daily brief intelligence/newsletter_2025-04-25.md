# THE DAILY BRIEF

### # market storm: geo tensions, trade talks, auto rivalry & digital disruption

## what matters now

markets are experiencing significant volatility driven by escalating india-pakistan tensions following the pahalgam attack, with the nifty sliding below 24,000 after erasing early gains. amid this uncertainty, earnings season reveals mixed results – ather energy's ipo preparations highlight india's ev ambitions, while gensol faces regulatory scrutiny and cratering stock prices. us-china trade tensions show signs of possible easing, though mixed messaging creates confusion. bitcoin's decoupling from tech stocks suggests it's emerging as a digital safe haven, while china signals potential monetary easing. corporate america shows strength with alphabet's earnings beat and $70b buyback announcement.

<u>**geopolitical tensions hammer markets**</u>

india's stock market experienced a dramatic reversal on april 25, with initial gains quickly evaporating as geopolitical tensions escalated following the tragic terrorist attack in pahalgam, kashmir that killed 26 civilians. the sensex plummeted nearly 1,100 points from its intraday high, while the nifty slipped below 24,000, erasing approximately ₹8.5 lakh crore in investor wealth.

pakistan's response further intensified market anxiety as it announced suspension of all trade with india (including via third countries), closed its airspace to indian airlines, and declared indian defense attachés persona non grata. india had already downgraded diplomatic ties and paused the indus water treaty, creating a significant escalation cycle that blindsided markets.

financial experts noted this pullback wasn't entirely unexpected after a strong seven-day rally that had pushed indices up by over 8%. the correction coincided with profit-booking in financial stocks, with axis bank, sbi, and bajaj finance acting as major drags on the sensex. vikash kumar jain of clsa cautioned that global events will continue driving indian market sentiment over the next 90 days, with local investors viewing india as a temporary "hiding place" amid international volatility.

this geopolitical shock comes at a particularly sensitive moment for markets already processing complex cross-currents: mixed earnings results, potential us rate cuts, and fluctuating us-china trade tensions. india's relative economic stability had positioned it as an attractive investment destination, but today's events demonstrate how quickly external shocks can disrupt market sentiment.

<u>**ather energy's premium play in a subsidy-challenged ev landscape**</u>

in a strategic pivot worthy of attention, ather energy has demonstrated remarkable adaptability in navigating the rapidly evolving electric two-wheeler market amid declining subsidies. preparing for its upcoming ipo on april 28 with a price band of ₹321 per share, ather has effectively transformed potential headwinds into a sustainable business model through software innovation.

the company's ingenious approach centers on the "ather propack," a software add-on that generates 6% of revenue with impressive 53-56% ebitda margins. this software play has helped ather increase overall gross margins from 7% to 19% year-on-year, effectively offsetting a dramatic 77% reduction in hardware subsidies. with 86-89% of customers opting for this premium feature – which enhances riding experience through capabilities like traction control and anti-theft alerts – ather has created a recurring revenue stream that positions it favorably against competitors.

the company's ipo represents a significant win for iit madras, which is set to earn approximately ₹50 crore from its initial backing, demonstrating the potential of academia-startup partnerships. other investors like tiger global anticipate an 8.3-fold return, while caladium investment and niif expect returns of 1.6x and 1.7x respectively.

this innovative approach to balancing product pricing and profit margins offers a potential blueprint for other ev manufacturers facing similar subsidy reductions. ather's model suggests that well-executed software strategies might be the key to maintaining profitability in a post-subsidy era – though customer willingness to pay premium prices will ultimately determine whether this strategy has broader applicability across the sector.

<u>**gensol's regulatory nightmare intensifies with forex probe**</u>

gensol engineering's downward spiral accelerated dramatically as the enforcement directorate (ed) initiated a foreign exchange investigation, executed searches across multiple locations, and issued a look-out circular against promoters puneet singh jaggi and anmol singh jaggi. this latest blow follows sebi's interim order barring the brothers from securities markets after uncovering alleged fund diversion of approximately ₹200 crore from loans ostensibly raised for electric vehicle purchases.

the company's stock has now fallen for 12 consecutive sessions, plummeting more than 44% in just two weeks and over 90% from its 52-week high of ₹1,125.75. this collapse reflects not just regulatory concerns but a fundamental crisis of confidence in the company's governance and financial reporting.

institutional oversight appears to be intensifying, with reports that the institute of chartered accountants of india (icai) has established a financial review board to investigate gensol and its affiliated company blusmart starting from fy23. this multi-pronged regulatory approach suggests authorities view the alleged irregularities as systemic rather than isolated incidents.

the cascading nature of gensol's crisis offers a stark lesson in how quickly trust can evaporate in public markets when questions about financial propriety emerge. credit rating agencies have already downgraded rs 2,050 crore of the company's debt to 'default' status, creating a nightmare scenario where declining share prices, regulatory restrictions, and credit downgrades reinforce each other in a downward spiral that becomes increasingly difficult to escape.

<u>**trade tensions: us-china mixed signals create market whiplash**</u>

trade relations between the us and china descended into confusing territory with contradictory statements creating market whiplash. president trump claimed active trade discussions were underway, stating "we've been meeting with china. there was a meeting this morning with china," while china's commerce ministry flatly denied any negotiations, insisting "any reports on developments in talks are groundless."

these mixed signals come amid reports that china may be considering exempting certain us goods from its retaliatory 125% tariffs, particularly in medical equipment, chemicals, plane leases, and semiconductors. us treasury secretary scott bessent indicated excessive tariffs might need reduction for productive negotiations, though unilateral cuts by trump seem unlikely.

market reactions reflected this uncertainty, with asian stocks showing significant volatility. south korean shares rose 1.1% after comments about possible trade agreements, while japanese equities increased 1% following substantial gains in the s&p 500. however, analysts remain cautious about corporate profit forecasts, fearing an economic slowdown as tariff impacts ripple through supply chains.

nomura analyst rob subbaraman offered a sobering assessment: "don't think trade deals will get done quickly, deals take a long time to do. for india/us, we may get a mou by later this year, but actual full deal can take years." this measured view contrasts with more optimistic market interpretations of recent diplomatic signals.

amidst this uncertainty, the us has made tangible progress with south korea and japan, setting frameworks for trade packages ahead of july tariff implementations. this suggests trump's strategy might involve prioritizing bilateral agreements with allies while maintaining a tough stance on china – a dynamic investors will need to monitor closely in coming weeks.

<u>**tech earnings: alphabet surges on cloud strength and ai momentum**</u>

alphabet delivered a knockout quarter that sent its stock soaring 4.9% in after-hours trading, reporting revenue of $90.23 billion (beating estimates of $89.12 billion) and a substantial net income of $34.5 billion. the company announced a massive $70 billion share buyback program and increased its dividend by 5%, signaling exceptional confidence in its financial position and future prospects.

particularly impressive was the 28% growth in google cloud revenue, which reached $12.3 billion, demonstrating alphabet's successful competitive positioning against amazon and microsoft in the critical cloud computing battleground. the company's advertising business also showed resilience with ad revenue increasing 8.5% year-over-year to $66.89 billion, though this represented a slower growth rate compared to the previous quarter's 10.6%.

significantly, alphabet received an $8 billion unrealized gain from its investment in spacex, highlighting the company's prescient venture capital strategy. having initially invested alongside fidelity in a $1 billion funding round in 2015, alphabet has seen this stake appreciate substantially, with spacex's valuation reportedly reaching approximately $350 billion based on a december 2024 share transaction.

alphabet's strong performance comes despite looming antitrust challenges that could potentially force significant operational restructuring, including possible divestment of its chrome browser and android products. u.s. government attorneys are advocating for these measures based on concerns that the integration of ai could further entrench google's dominance in online search and advertising.

the results reinforce alphabet's resilience and adaptability in navigating both intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny, with its diversified revenue streams and strategic investments providing multiple avenues for continued growth despite these challenges.

<u>**bitcoin's golden moment: decoupling from tech, emerging as "digital gold"**</u>

bitcoin appears to be achieving a significant milestone in its evolution as a financial asset, showing clear signs of decoupling from technology stocks. according to chris wood, global head of equity strategy at jefferies, bitcoin has surged 20% since april 8, 2025, while the nasdaq has declined 2.4% during the same period – a divergence that suggests bitcoin is finally establishing itself as a legitimate store of value independent of tech sector performance.

this shift represents a crucial development in bitcoin's maturation process. historically, bitcoin has traded in tandem with technology stocks, leading critics to dismiss claims that it functions as "digital gold" or a hedge against economic uncertainty. the current decoupling challenges this narrative, potentially validating bitcoin proponents who have long argued that the cryptocurrency would eventually mirror gold's behavior during periods of market stress.

several factors may be driving this trend, including growing concerns about u.s. fiscal policies under the trump administration, rising treasury yields, and increasing geopolitical instability. these conditions have amplified demand for reliable stores of value, benefiting both bitcoin and gold. notably, this shift is occurring despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty and historical volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

the potential implications are substantial. if bitcoin continues to behave more like gold than tech stocks during market downturns, institutional investors may increasingly view it as a legitimate diversification tool and hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. this could bring significant new capital into the crypto ecosystem and potentially stabilize bitcoin's historically volatile price action – though whether this represents a permanent shift or temporary correlation remains to be seen.

<u>**china's economic balancing act: easing signals amid trade turbulence**</u>

china's politburo has signaled a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy, with the people's bank of china (pboc) governor reiterating that monetary policy will be "moderately loose" while pledging to "cut the rrr and interest rates in a timely manner." this stance comes as chinese authorities attempt to navigate the complex interplay between domestic economic challenges and escalating international trade tensions.

the politburo meeting, presided over by xi jinping, emphasized coordinating domestic economic efforts while managing international trade challenges, promising to "increase the incomes of middle- and low-income groups" and "vigorously develop service consumption." these statements reflect a growing recognition that china's economy requires additional support amid both structural transitions and external pressures.

chinese markets have responded positively to these signals, with the csi300 index, shanghai composite index, and hang seng index all achieving their highest values since early april. the week's gains reached 2.7%, representing the best performance in nearly two months. this optimism has been further bolstered by china's pragmatic response to u.s. tariffs, including the provision of exemptions on certain u.s. imports to mitigate economic impacts.

however, market strategists advise caution. eugene hsiao emphasized a 'wait-and-see' approach due to recent volatility, while others are adopting a diversified investment strategy that emphasizes technology and consumer staples, particularly favoring companies with robust pricing power and resilience against tariff-related challenges.

the pboc's messaging suggests china is preparing to deploy significant monetary tools to support growth, potentially setting the stage for policy divergence with the u.s. federal reserve – a dynamic that could have substantial implications for global capital flows and currency markets in the coming months.

<u>**ev industry disruption: chinese rare earth export restrictions hit indian manufacturers**</u>

a concerning development has emerged for india's electric vehicle industry as china has reportedly restricted the supply of rare earth magnets to india since april 4, creating potentially significant disruptions for manufacturers. these magnets are critical components in traction motors and other essential ev parts, making this restriction a substantial threat to india's growing electric mobility sector.

according to industry sources, china is now demanding that importers submit end-user certificates signed by both the ministry of external affairs and the chinese embassy, confirming that the rare earth magnets will not be used for weapons manufacturing. this new bureaucratic requirement effectively serves as a non-tariff barrier that could substantially delay or prevent shipments.

the timing is particularly problematic for india's ev sector, which has been gaining momentum. companies like ather energy, which is preparing for its ipo, and other manufacturers may face supply chain challenges that could impact production schedules and costs. the restriction also highlights india's vulnerability in critical mineral supply chains, a strategic weakness that has implications beyond just the transportation sector.

automobile and component manufacturers have reportedly approached the indian government for assistance, though immediate solutions may be limited given the specialized nature of these materials and china's dominant position in the rare earth processing industry. this development underscores the urgent need for supply chain diversification and domestic capacity development in critical mineral processing – priorities that align with india's broader self-reliance initiatives but will require significant time and investment to achieve.

the situation represents yet another dimension of the complex technological and trade competition between major powers, with ripple effects that extend into multiple industries and supply chains.

<u>**auto sector crossroads: delhi's hybrid vehicle incentives spark industry debate**</u>

delhi's draft ev policy has unexpectedly created division within india's automotive industry by proposing to extend road tax and registration fee waivers – previously exclusive to electric vehicles – to hybrid cars as well. this policy shift has triggered intense debate among manufacturers about the appropriate level of government support for different green mobility technologies.

industry sources report that major players including hyundai, mg, tata motors, mahindra, and kia are meeting with delhi government officials to express concerns about equating hybrids with fully electric vehicles in terms of incentives. the controversy highlights the complex technological and policy tradeoffs in india's transition to cleaner transportation, with pure ev manufacturers arguing that hybrids don't deserve equivalent support given their continued reliance on internal combustion engines.

though delhi represents only about 5% of india's passenger vehicle market, its policies often influence other states due to its capital status and focus on air quality improvements. bofa securities analysts note that while "delhi with 5% salience in pv cannot move needle by itself for hybrid adoption in india," it "is seen as a progressive state on green mobility & can set a precedent for other states."

the timing is particularly relevant for maruti suzuki, which has invested heavily in hybrid technology as part of its green mobility strategy. the company's q4 results showed a 1% year-on-year decrease in consolidated profit to ₹3,911 crore despite a 6.4% revenue increase to ₹40,920 crore, with declining margins partially attributed to new product launch costs.

this policy debate reflects broader questions about the optimal path to transportation decarbonization in india – whether through rapid full electrification or a transitional approach incorporating hybrid technologies – and how government incentives should be structured to encourage the most effective emissions reductions.
