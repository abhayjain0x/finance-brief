# THE DAILY BRIEF

### # us-china trade tensions, rbis liquidity push, record gold prices & tech landscape shifts

## what matters now

The escalating US-China trade war dominated markets this week, with Trump imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting China's retaliatory 125% tariffs. The dollar weakened dramatically, falling below 100 for the first time since July 2023, while gold surged to historic highs above $3,200. Market volatility triggered the worst Treasury sell-off since 2001, raising concerns about US economic resilience. Meanwhile, the RBI announced plans to inject ₹40,000 crore through OMOs to improve banking system liquidity. Big banks showed surprisingly strong Q1 performance despite the turbulence, while TCS deferred wage hikes due to business uncertainties, signaling caution in the tech sector.

<u>**US-China trade war intensifies as both sides ratchet up tariffs**</u>

The US-China trade war has escalated dramatically, with President **Trump** implementing a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, followed by **Beijing's** retaliatory imposition of 125% tariffs on US goods. This escalation has sent significant shockwaves through global markets, with Trump subsequently announcing a 90-day pause on additional 26% tariffs against India and other countries—providing temporary relief but leaving fundamental uncertainties unresolved.

According to **UN economists**, these measures could potentially shrink global trade by 3%, with **Jamie Dimon**, CEO of **JPMorgan Chase**, warning that the uncertainty created by these tariffs could lead to a recession. The bank has taken the precautionary step of setting aside **$973 million** for potential loan defaults, significantly exceeding analysts' predictions of $290 million—a telling indicator of growing economic concern.

The immediate market reaction has been profound. US stocks experienced one of their most volatile weeks in recent memory, with the **S&P 500** witnessing a dramatic 9.5% single-day rise—its largest since the 2008 financial crisis—while remaining about 13% below its all-time high from February. This volatility reflects the deeper concerns permeating through various market segments, suggesting that traders are struggling to price in both the immediate and longer-term consequences of these trade barriers.

Howard Marks, co-founder of **Oaktree Capital**, has drawn a sobering parallel between Trump's tariff policies and **Brexit**, suggesting both might prove to be "own goals" leading to serious economic dislocation. The market's nervous oscillations seem to validate this concern, with risk assets likely to continue struggling until bond markets stabilize and greater policy clarity emerges.

<u>**Dollar tumbles below critical psychological threshold as gold reaches historic heights**</u>

The US dollar has suffered a remarkable decline, falling below the psychologically significant level of **100** for the first time since **July 2023** as concerns mount about its status as the world's primary reserve currency. This drop represents a broader loss of confidence among investors regarding US asset safety, triggering a substantial exodus from traditional US investments.

In stark contrast, gold has surged to unprecedented heights, reaching a record **$3,245.28** per ounce amid escalating geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. In India, gold prices skyrocketed by **₹6,250** to breach the **₹96,450** per 10 grams level. This remarkable ascent reflects investors' flight to tangible assets perceived as safer during tumultuous periods—a classic manifestation of market anxiety.

The interplay between falling dollar values and rising gold prices underscores a fundamental shift in investor sentiment. As **Tai Wong**, an independent metals trader, noted, while a minor correction in gold prices may occur, the long-term outlook remains bullish due to inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve's potential policies. This sentiment is further reinforced by **UBS**, which emphasizes that ongoing economic uncertainties will continue to enhance gold's attractiveness among investors.

What makes this situation particularly noteworthy is the broader reappraisal of US assets occurring simultaneously with these currency movements. The traditional inverse relationship between the dollar and gold is playing out dramatically, signaling deeper structural concerns about the stability of the global financial system. As investors recalibrate their portfolios in response to these seismic shifts, we're likely witnessing not just a temporary market adjustment but potentially the early stages of a more fundamental realignment in global capital flows.

<u>**Treasury market experiences worst sell-off since 2001, rattling investor confidence**</u>

The US Treasury market has experienced its most severe sell-off since 2001, with yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note surging to **4.59%**. This extraordinary movement signals a profound shift in investor sentiment, as Treasuries—traditionally considered the ultimate safe-haven asset—are being aggressively sold despite rising market volatility, upending conventional market dynamics.

The sell-off has sparked intense debate among bond analysts regarding potential Chinese influence, given that China is the second-largest foreign holder of US Treasuries (after Japan). While some speculate that Beijing might be strategically selling holdings in response to Trump's tariffs, evidence remains inconclusive. What is clear, however, is that China has reduced its Treasury holdings to the lowest levels since 2011, though determining whether recent market movements reflect deliberate policy or broader market factors remains challenging.

The ripple effects of this Treasury market turbulence extend far beyond bond trading floors. Rising yields directly translate to higher borrowing costs for both consumers and corporations, potentially stifling economic growth as companies might need to pass costs to customers or reduce their workforce. More fundamentally, this unusual market behavior—where bonds and stocks sell off simultaneously—challenges the traditional portfolio diversification strategies that have underpinned investment approaches for decades.

**Jamie Dimon** of JPMorgan has predicted a Treasury market "kerfuffle" that may necessitate Federal Reserve intervention, a view echoed by **Boston Fed President Susan Collins**, who confirmed the Fed stands ready to stabilize markets if conditions become disorderly. This unusual alignment between a major bank CEO and Fed officials highlights the severity of current market concerns and suggests potential policy responses may be forthcoming if volatility persists.

<u>**RBI takes decisive action to boost banking system liquidity**</u>

The **Reserve Bank of India** has announced significant measures to enhance banking system liquidity, planning to inject **₹40,000 crore** through Open Market Operations (OMOs) while also executing a **43-day Variable Rate Repo** auction worth **₹1.5 lakh crore**. This substantial intervention aims to increase the banking system liquidity surplus to approximately **1% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)**, particularly to offset the impact of Goods and Services Tax outflows that typically occur around the 20th of each month.

RBI Governor **Sanjay Malhotra** emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate liquidity to facilitate quicker transmission of policy rates to interest rates throughout the economy. The timing is strategic—following an average liquidity surplus of **₹1.7 lakh crore** in April, a notable recovery from the **₹3 lakh crore deficit** recorded earlier in the year. By scheduling the auctions for **April 17**, with additional OMOs of **₹20,000 crore** planned for April 22 and 29, the RBI demonstrates a proactive approach to managing liquidity challenges.

This intervention should be viewed in the broader context of the RBI's recent **rate cut** from **6.25% to 6%** during its latest monetary policy committee meeting, which has already led to banks like **Indian Overseas Bank** reducing their repo-linked lending rates. Together, these measures reflect the RBI's comprehensive strategy to support economic growth while ensuring financial system stability during a period of global economic uncertainty.

For investors and market participants, these liquidity measures signal the RBI's commitment to maintaining favorable conditions for credit growth, potentially leading to enhanced business activity and investment opportunities in the coming months. The approach also demonstrates how India's central bank is taking preemptive actions to insulate domestic markets from external volatilities—a increasingly important consideration given the current global trade tensions.

<u>**Big banks post strong Q1 results despite market turbulence**</u>

Major US banks delivered surprisingly robust first-quarter earnings despite significant market volatility, with **JPMorgan Chase** reporting a **9% rise** in profit to **$14.6 billion**, handily exceeding analysts' expectations. The bank's stock traders achieved record revenue of **$3.81 billion**—a remarkable **48% increase** driven by heightened market swings associated with Trump's policy announcements.

Similarly, **Morgan Stanley** posted a significant earnings beat with profits reaching approximately **$4.3 billion** ($2.60 per share), up from **$3.4 billion** ($2.02 per share) in the same period last year and surpassing LSEG estimates of $2.20 per share. The firm's equity trading saw notable growth attributed to portfolio rebalancing activities among investors, particularly in technology and industrial sectors.

**Wells Fargo** also outperformed expectations with a **6% rise** in profit to **$4.89 billion** ($1.39 per share vs. estimates of $1.24), benefiting from continued cost-cutting measures and reduced provisions for potential loan losses. The bank experienced a **24% increase** in investment banking fees, attributed to heightened activity in debt capital markets.

These strong performances come with important caveats, however. Bank executives, particularly **Jamie Dimon**, have expressed significant concerns regarding the economic outlook. Dimon warned about "considerable turbulence" facing the economy and potential recession risks stemming from trade conflicts. Similarly, **Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf** cautioned that US tariffs may dampen economic growth and increase loan default likelihood.

The divergence between current financial performance and forward-looking caution from banking leaders creates an intriguing tension in the market. While these institutions have demonstrated remarkable resilience through turbulent times, their leadership appears to be battening down the hatches for potentially rougher seas ahead—a sobering reminder that current profits may not necessarily indicate future performance in an increasingly uncertain global economy.

<u>**TCS defers wage hikes amid business uncertainties from tariff tensions**</u>

**Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** has announced the postponement of annual salary increases for its approximately **607,000 employees** due to ongoing business uncertainties primarily stemming from tariff-related issues affecting the tech industry. This decision, conveyed by TCS's Chief Human Resources Officer **Milind Lakkad**, marks a significant departure from the company's typical practice of implementing annual raises in April.

The announcement coincided with TCS reporting a **1.68% decline** in net profit for Q4, falling to **₹12,224 crore** from **₹12,434 crore** in the prior year, despite a **5.29% revenue growth** to **₹64,479 crore**. The company's managing director, **K Krithivasan**, described the market environment as one where customers are in "wait-and-watch mode," particularly regarding the impact of tariffs, with approximately **30-40%** of TCS's work classified as "discretionary" and thus potentially vulnerable to delays or cutbacks.

This cautionary stance from India's largest IT services company signals broader concerns across the tech sector. TCS executives reported seeing "some minor ramp-downs and delays in decision making," though they emphasized they haven't observed "any major project cancellations" yet. The distinction is important—suggesting businesses are pausing rather than abandoning technology initiatives, which could indicate a temporary rather than structural slowdown.

The company still managed to secure a healthy order book valued at approximately **$12.2 billion**, with **$6.8 billion** coming from North America—its highest ever from that region. This seemingly contradictory situation of strong bookings alongside cautious execution reflects the complex current market dynamics, where long-term digital transformation needs remain intact while near-term implementation faces heightened scrutiny amid economic uncertainties.

TCS's organizational response included several key appointments, notably promoting **Aarthi Subramanian** to Chief Operating Officer, suggesting the company is simultaneously preparing for both near-term challenges and eventual recovery. The wage deferral should be viewed not merely as a cost-cutting measure but as a strategic pause while the company assesses how global trade tensions will ultimately impact technology spending patterns.

<u>**AI implementation proving more challenging than anticipated, says Nilekani**</u>

**Nandan Nilekani**, co-founder of **Infosys**, has expressed notable skepticism about the current state of artificial intelligence implementation, particularly in enterprise environments. Speaking at Carnegie India's Global Technology Summit, Nilekani highlighted that creating effective AI systems is proving significantly more challenging than many had anticipated, with organizations demonstrating clear reluctance to delegate decision-making to error-prone models.

Nilekani's assessment is particularly noteworthy coming from one of India's most prominent technology visionaries. He emphasized that the core challenge lies not in developing the technology itself, but in achieving cost-effectiveness—specifically citing the need for a "cost per inference" as low as **₹1** for widespread adoption. This practical focus on economics rather than purely technological capabilities reflects a maturing perspective on AI's place in business operations.

For the public sector, Nilekani identified even greater complexities, pointing to structural barriers within government entities that inhibit the data sharing essential for effective AI training. This observation touches on a fundamental paradox: while governments control vast data resources that could power transformative AI applications, their organizational structures often impede the very sharing mechanisms needed to realize this potential.

Interestingly, Nilekani downplayed the need for India to develop its own indigenous large language models, suggesting instead that the focus should be on ensuring existing models work effectively for India's large population while addressing accuracy and bias issues. This pragmatic approach stands in contrast to nationalist technology narratives that have gained traction in various countries, including India.

The timing of these comments is particularly relevant as companies worldwide grapple with the gap between AI's theoretical promise and practical implementation challenges. As businesses face mounting pressure to demonstrate return on their substantial AI investments, Nilekani's caution serves as a valuable counterpoint to the often breathless enthusiasm that has characterized much of the discourse around artificial intelligence.

<u>**India making strategic moves in semiconductor and nuclear energy sectors**</u>

India is positioning itself to become a significant player in the **$656 billion global semiconductor market**, according to the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA). The country has attracted over **$20 billion** in investment commitments through its **Semicon India Programme**, which includes a substantial **₹76,000 crore** incentive package aimed at stimulating domestic chip production. This push comes as global semiconductor revenue reached **$655.9 billion** in 2024, reflecting a **21% increase** from 2023, largely driven by AI infrastructure demand.

In a parallel development showcasing India's strategic energy ambitions, **Maharashtra** has signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia's **Rosatom** to develop thorium-based small modular reactors. This collaboration is particularly significant given India's vast thorium reserves, estimated to be among the largest in the world. The partnership aims to leverage India's thorium resources while advancing nuclear technology that could potentially provide cleaner energy solutions.

These initiatives reflect India's dual approach to technological sovereignty: developing domestic capabilities while strategically engaging with international partners. The semiconductor push addresses a critical vulnerability exposed during the pandemic-induced chip shortage, while the nuclear energy partnership diversifies India's energy portfolio at a time when climate considerations are reshaping global energy strategies.

Both sectors also represent high-value knowledge economies that align with India's aspirations to move up the global value chain. By focusing on these advanced technology domains, India is not merely seeking economic benefits but also attempting to establish itself as a key player in industries that will likely define global technological competitiveness in the coming decades.

What's particularly interesting is the timing of these moves, coming amid broader global technological decoupling trends. As tensions between the US and China reshape global supply chains, India appears to be methodically positioning itself as an alternative manufacturing hub and technological partner, leveraging geopolitical shifts to advance its own industrial development agenda.

<u>**NSE achieves 22 crore investor milestone as market participation surges**</u>

The **National Stock Exchange (NSE)** of India has reached a significant milestone by surpassing **22 crore (220 million)** investor accounts, achieving this just **six months** after reaching the **20 crore mark** in October 2024. This remarkable growth reflects a robust expansion in retail investor participation across India, with the exchange now serving **11.3 crore unique investors** as of March 2025.

The geographic distribution of this investor base reveals interesting patterns of financial inclusion. **Maharashtra** leads with **3.8 crore accounts**, followed by **Uttar Pradesh** (2.4 crore) and **Gujarat** (1.9 crore), with the top ten states accounting for nearly **75%** of all investor accounts. Perhaps more significantly, **Sriram Krishnan**, Chief Business Development Officer at NSE, highlighted a pronounced trend of increasing equity investment among retail participants in **tier-2, 3, and 4 cities**—suggesting a democratization of market access beyond traditional financial centers.

This expanding investor base has been supported by several converging factors: increased digital access, the proliferation of mobile trading platforms, improved financial literacy initiatives, and robust market performance. The **Nifty 50** and **Nifty 500** have delivered impressive annualized returns of **22%** and **25%** respectively over the past five years, providing concrete incentives for new market entrants.

The NSE's investor protection fund has grown correspondingly, increasing by **23%** year-over-year to reach **₹2,459 crore** by March 2025, providing an additional layer of security that likely contributes to growing investor confidence. This comprehensive ecosystem development—combining access, education, performance, and protection—represents a textbook example of how to build sustainable market growth.

What makes this milestone particularly noteworthy is that it occurs against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty and market volatility. The continued influx of domestic retail investors suggests a growing financial sophistication among Indian households and potentially represents a structural shift that could help insulate Indian markets from the full impact of foreign institutional investor outflows during periods of global risk aversion.
